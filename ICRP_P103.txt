Annals of the ICRP
Published on behalf of the International Commission
on Radiological Protection
Aims and Scope
The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is the primary body in protection against ionising
radiation. ICRP is a registered charity and is thus an independent non-governmental organisation created by the1928 International Congress of Radiology to advance for the public beneﬁt the science of radiological protection.
The ICRP provides recommendations and guidance on protection against the risks associated with ionishing ra-
diation, from artiﬁcial sources widely used in medicine, general industry and nuclear enterprises, and from naturallyoccurring sources. These reports and recommendations are published four times each year on behalf of the ICRP asthe journal Annals of the ICRP. Each issue provides in-depth coverage of a speciﬁc subject area.
Subscribers to the journal receive each new report as soon as it appears so that they are kept up to date on the latest
developments in this important ﬁeld. While many subscribers prefer to acquire a complete set of ICRP reports andrecommendations, single issues of the journal are also available separately for those individuals and organizations
needing a single report covering their own ﬁeld of interest. Please order through your bookseller, subscription agent,
or direct from the publisher.
ICRP is composed of a Main Commission and ﬁve standing Committees on: radiation eﬀects, doses from radiation
exposure, protection in medicine, the application of ICRP recommendations, and protection of the environment, all
served by a small Scientiﬁc Secretariat. The Main Commission consists of twelve members and a Chairman.
Committees typically comprise 15–20 members. Biologists and medical doctors dominate the current membership;physicists are also well represented.
ICRP uses Working Parties to develop ideas and Task Groups to prepare its reports. A Task Group is usually
chaired by an ICRP Committee member and usually contains a majority of specialists from outside ICRP. Thus,
ICRP is an independent international network of specialists in various ﬁelds of radiological protection. At any onetime, about one hundred eminent scientists are actively involved in the work of ICRP. The Task Groups are assigned
the responsibility for drafting documents on various subjects, which are reviewed and ﬁnally approved by the Main
Commission. These documents are then published as the Annals of the ICRP.

Abstract –These revised Recommendations for a System of Radiological Protection formally
replace the Commission’s previous, 1990, Recommendations; and update, consolidate, and
develop the additional guidance on the control of exposure from radiation sources issued since
1990.
Thus, the present Recommendations update the radiation and tissue weighting factors in the
quantities equivalent and effective dose and update the radiation detriment, based on the latest
available scientific information of the biology and physics of radiation exposure. Theymaintain the Commission’s three fundamental principles of radiological protection, namelyjustification, optimisation, and the application of dose limits, clarifying how they apply to
radiation sources delivering exposure and to individuals receiving exposure.
The Recommendations evolve from the previous process-based protection approach using
practices and interventions by moving to an approach based on the exposure situation. They
recognise planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations, and apply the fundamental
principles of justification and optimisation of protection to all of these situations. Theymaintain the Commission’s current individual dose limits for effective dose and equivalent
dose from all regulated sources in planned exposure situations. They re-inforce the principle of
optimisation of protection, which should be applicable in a similar way to all exposuresituations, subject to the following restrictions on individual doses and risks; dose and risk
constraints for planned exposure situations, and reference levels for emergency and existing
exposure situations. The Recommendations also include an approach for developing aframework to demonstrate radiological protection of the environment./C2112007 ICRP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP
The new recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Pro-
tection were adopted on 21 March 2007, Essen, Germany, after eight years of discus-sions, involving scientists, regulators, and users all around the world.
The Commission is an advisory body that oﬀers its recommendations to regula-
tory and advisory agencies, mainly by providing guidance on the fundamental prin-
ciples on which appropriate radiological protection can be based. Since its inception
in 1928, the Commission has regularly issued recommendations regarding protectionagainst the hazards of ionising radiation. The ﬁrst report in the current series, Pub-
lication 1, contained the recommendations adopted in 1958 ( ICRP, 1959 ). The more
recent recommendations have appeared as Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977 ), and Publi-
cation 60 (ICRP, 1991b ), and contain the recommendations adopted in 1977 and
1990, respectively.
International organisations and national authorities responsible for radiological
protection, as well as the users, have taken the recommendations and principles is-
sued by the Commission as a key basis for their protective actions. As such, virtuallyall international standards and national regulations addressing radiological protec-tion are based on the Commission’s recommendations.
Currently, most national regulations are based on the 1990 Recommendations in
Publication 60 . International standards, such as the International Basic Safety Stan-
dards, various international labour conventions, and European directives on radio-logical protection are also based on these recommendations.
InPublication 26 , the Commission quantiﬁed the risks of stochastic eﬀects of radi-
ation and proposed a system of dose limitation with its three principles of justiﬁca-tion, optimisation of protection, and individual dose limitation. In Publication 60 ,
the Commission revised its recommendations and extended its philosophy to a sys-tem of radiological protection while keeping the fundamental principles ofprotection.
New scientiﬁc data have been published since Publication 60 , and while the biolog-
ical and physical assumptions and concepts remain robust, some updating is re-
quired. The overall estimate of deterministic eﬀects remain fundamentally the
same. The estimates of cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure have not chan-ged greatly in the past 17 years, whereas the estimated risk of heritable eﬀects is cur-rently lower than before. The new data provide a ﬁrmer basis on which to modelrisks and assess detriment.ICRP Publication 103
3The 2007 Recommendations evolve from the previous process-based approach of
practices and interventions to an approach based on the characteristics of radiationexposure situations. The system of radiological protection applies in principle to anysituation of radiation exposure. Similar procedures are used for deciding on the ex-tent and level of protective actions, regardless of exposure situation. Speciﬁcally, the
principles of justiﬁcation and optimisation apply universally. ICRP is of the opinion
that by focusing more on optimisation, the implementation of protection for whathas until now been categorised as interventions could be enhanced.
In view of the importance aﬀorded to the Commission’s recommendations and to
ensure that the new recommendations adequately and appropriately address na-tional issues and concerns, the Commission has initiated a much more open processthan that used for the development of the previous recommendations. It should alsobe noted that the Commission mentions, for the ﬁrst time, the need to account for
the views and concerns of stakeholders when optimising protection.
The Commission has therefore solicited input from a broad spectrum of radiolog-
ical protection stakeholders, ranging from government institutions and internationalorganisations to scientists and non-governmental organisations. The draft recom-mendations have been discussed at a large number of international and national con-ferences and by the many international and national organisations with an interest inradiological protection.
Many of these also arranged particular activities around the Recommendations
project. Thus for instance, the International Radiation Protection Association ar-
ranged reviews through its member organisations world-wide for their 2000 and2004 Congresses and in connection with our 2006 public consultation, the NuclearEnergy Agency of the OECD organised seven international workshops and per-formed four detailed assessments of draft ICRP texts (in 2003, 2004, 2006, and2007), and the European Commission organised a seminar in 2006 to debate the sci-entiﬁc issues in the Recommendations. The United Nations agencies, with the Inter-national Atomic Energy Agency as the lead agency, are using the 2007 ICRP
Recommendations as a major input to their project of revising the International Ba-
sic Safety Standards, and likewise the European Commission uses the 2007 Recom-mendations as a major input to their revision of the European Basic SafetyStandards.
The Recommendations have been prepared after two phases of international pub-
lic consultation. By following this policy of transparency and involvement of stake-holders, ICRP is expecting a clearer understanding and wide acceptance of itsRecommendations. Although the revised Recommendations do not contain any fun-
damental changes to the radiological protection policy, they will help to clarify appli-
cation of the system of protection in the plethora of exposure situations encountered,thereby improving the already high standards of protection.
The Commission is pleased at having arrived at the end of a long but useful ges-
tation phase including numerous consultations and is proud to present these 2007Recommendations. The extensive consultations resulted in a much improved docu-ment and the Commission is grateful to the many organisations, experts, and indi-vidual members of the public who have devoted so much of their time andICRP Publication 103
4experience to helping us to improve the Recommendations. Their contributions have
been crucial for the future success of the 2007 Recommendations.

8PREFACE
Since issuing its 1990 Recommendations as ICRP Publication 60 (ICRP 1991b),
the Commission has reviewed these Recommendations regularly and, from time totime, has issued supplementary reports in the Annals of the ICRP . The extent of these
supplementary reports has indicated the need for the consolidation and rationalisa-tion presented here. New scientiﬁc data have also been published since Publication
60, and while the biological and physical assumptions and concepts remain robust,
some updating is required. The overall estimates of deterministic eﬀects and stochas-
tic risk remain fundamentally the same. The overall estimates of cancer risk attrib-utable to radiation exposure have not changed appreciably in the past 16 years.Conversely, the estimated risk of heritable eﬀects is currently lower than before.Overall, the new data provide a ﬁrmer basis on which to model risks and assess det-riment. Finally, it has also become apparent that the radiological protection of theenvironment should receive more emphasis than in the past.
Therefore, while recognising the need for stability in international and national
regulations, the Commission has decided to issue these revised Recommendations
having two primary aims in mind:
/C15to take account of new biological and physical information and of trends in the
setting of radiation safety standards; and
/C15to improve and streamline the presentation of the Recommendations.
In addition, the Commission has maintained as much stability in the Recommen-
dations as is consistent with the new scientiﬁc information and societal expectations.
In its revised System of Protection, the Recommendations of the Commission now
evolve from the previous process-based approach of practices and interventions toan approach based on the characteristics of radiation exposure situations. In takingthis approach, the Commission wishes to aﬃrm that its system of protection can beapplied in principle to any situation of radiation exposure. Similar procedures areused for deciding on the extent and level of protective actions, regardless of exposuresituation. Speciﬁcally, the principles of justiﬁcation and optimisation apply univer-sally. The Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of protection for
what has until now been categorised as interventions could be enhanced by increas-
ing the attention to these common features.
These Recommendations were produced by the Main Commission of ICRP, based
on an earlier draft that was subjected to public and internal consultation in 2004 andagain, in revised form, in 2006. By introducing more transparency and by involvingthe many organisations and individuals having an interest in radiological protectionin the revision process, the Commission is expecting a better common understandingand acceptance of its Recommendations.

tional organisations, governmental as well as non-governmental, and all individualswho contributed in the development of these Recommendations.ICRP Publication 103
10EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
(a) On 21 March 2007, the Main Commission of the International Commission on
Radiological Protection (ICRP) approved these revised Recommendations for a Sys-tem of Radiological Protection which formally replace the previous Recommenda-tions issued in 1991 as Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) and update the additional
guidance on the control of exposure from radiation sources issued since Publication
60. These revised Recommendations consolidate and develop the previous Recom-
mendations and guidance.
(b) The Commission has prepared these Recommendations after two phases of
international public consultation, one in 2004 and one in 2006, on draft Recommen-dations. By following this policy of transparency and involvement of stakeholders,the Commission is anticipating a clearer understanding and wider acceptance ofits Recommendations.
(c) The major features of the present Recommendations are:
/C15Updating the radiation and tissue weighting factors in the quantities equivalent
and eﬀective dose, and updating the radiation detriment based on the latest avail-able scientiﬁc information of the biology and physics of radiation exposure;
/C15Maintaining the Commission’s three fundamental principles of radiological pro-
tection, namely justiﬁcation, optimisation, and the application of dose limits,
and clarifying how they apply to radiation sources delivering exposure and to
individuals receiving exposure;
/C15Evolving from the previous process-based protection approach using practices
and interventions, by moving to a situation-based approach applying the funda-mental principles of justiﬁcation and optimisation of protection to all controllableexposure situations, which the present Recommendations characterise as planned,emergency, and existing exposure situations;
/C15Maintaining the Commission’s individual dose limits for eﬀective dose and equiv-
alent dose from all regulated sources in planned exposure situations – these limits
represent the maximum dose that would be accepted in any planned exposure sit-uations by regulatory authorities;
/C15Re-enforcing the principle of optimisation of protection, which should be applica-
ble in a similar way to all exposure situations, with restrictions on individual dosesand risks, namely dose and risk constraints for planned exposure situations andreference levels for emergency and existing exposure situations; and
/C15Including an approach for developing a framework to demonstrate radiological
protection of the environment.
(d) The Commission’s system of radiological protection applies to all exposures to
ionising radiation from any source, regardless of its size and origin. However, the
Recommendations can apply in their entirety only to situations in which either thesource of exposure or the pathways leading to the doses received by individualscan be controlled by some reasonable means. Some exposure situations are excludedfrom radiological protection legislation, usually on the basis that they are uname-nable to control with regulatory instruments, and some exposure situations are
11exempted from some or all radiological protection regulatory requirements where
such controls are regarded as unwarranted.
(e) An understanding of the health eﬀects of ionising radiation is central to the
Commission’s Recommendations. Following a review of the biological and epide-miological information on the health risks attributable to ionising radiation, the
Commission has reached the following conclusions. The distribution of risks to
diﬀerent organs/tissues is judged to have changed somewhat since Publication 60 ,
particularly in respect of the risks of breast cancer and heritable disease. However,assuming a linear response at low doses, the combined detriment due to excesscancer and heritable eﬀects remains unchanged at around 5% per Sv. Embodiedin this current estimate is the use of a dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor forsolid cancers which is unchanged at a value of 2. The Commission also judgesthat, following prenatal exposure, a) cancer risk will be similar to that following
irradiation in early childhood and b) threshold dose exists for the induction of
malformations and for the expression of severe mental retardation. The Commis-sion has retained the eﬀective dose limits and the equivalent dose limits for theskin, hands/feet, and eye given in Publication 60 but recognises that further infor-
mation is needed and revised judgements may be required particularly in respect ofthe eye. The available data on possible excess in non-cancer diseases (e.g., cardio-vascular disorders) are judged to be insuﬃcient to inform on risks at low doses.
(f) The Commission’s extensive review of the health eﬀects of ionising radiation
has, however, not indicated that any fundamental changes are needed to the system
of radiological protection. Importantly, existing numerical recommendations in thepolicy guidance issued since 1991 remain valid unless otherwise stated. Therefore,these revised Recommendations should not imply any substantial changes to radio-logical protection regulations that are based on its previous Recommendations andsubsequent policy guidance.
(g) The central assumption of a linear dose–response relationship for the induction
of cancer and heritable eﬀects, according to which an increment in dose induces a
proportional increment in risk even at low doses, continues to provide the basis
for the summation of doses from external sources of radiation and from intakesof radionuclides.
(h) The use of equivalent and eﬀective dose remains unchanged, but a number of
revisions have been made to the methods used in their calculation. Reviews of therange of available data on the relative biological eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent radiations,together with biophysical considerations, have led to changes to the values of radi-ation weighting factors used for neutrons and protons, with values for neutrons
given as a continuous function of neutron energy, and the inclusion of a value for
charged pions. Radiation weighting factors for photons, electrons, muons, and alphaparticles are unchanged.
(i) An important change is that doses from external and internal sources will be
calculated using reference computational phantoms of the human body based onmedical tomographic images, replacing the use of various mathematical models.For adults, equivalent doses will be calculated by sex-averaging of values obtainedusing male and female phantoms. Eﬀective dose will then be calculated using revisedICRP Publication 103
12age- and sex-averaged tissue weighting factors, based on updated risk data and in-
tended to apply as rounded values to a population of both sexes and all ages. Eﬀec-tive dose is calculated for a Reference Person and not for an individual.
(j) Eﬀective dose is intended for use as a protection quantity. The main uses of
eﬀective dose are the prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation in
radiological protection, and demonstration of compliance with dose limits for regu-
latory purposes. Eﬀective dose is not recommended for epidemiological evaluations,nor should it be used for detailed speciﬁc retrospective investigations of individualexposure and risk.
(k) The collective eﬀective dose quantity is an instrument for optimisation, for
comparing radiological technologies and protection procedures, predominantly inthe context of occupational exposure. Collective eﬀective dose is not intended asa tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk
projections. The aggregation of very low individual doses over extended time peri-
ods is inappropriate, and in particular, the calculation of the number of cancerdeaths based on collective eﬀective doses from trivial individual doses should beavoided.
(l) In order to assess radiation doses, models are necessary to simulate the geom-
etry of the external exposure, the biokinetics of incorporated radionuclides, and thehuman body. The reference models and necessary reference parameter values areestablished and selected from a range of experimental investigations and human
studies through judgements. For regulatory purposes, these models and parameter
values are ﬁxed by convention and are not subject to uncertainty. The Commissionis aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values.Eﬀorts are undertaken to critically evaluate and to reduce the uncertainties. For indi-vidual retrospective dose and risk assessments, individual parameters and uncertain-ties have to be taken into account.
(m) The Commission’s process of consolidation of previous guidance and recom-
mendations has indicated that some changes to the structure and terminology of the
system of protection were desirable in order to improve clarity and utility. In partic-
ular the distinction between practices and interventions may not have been clearlyunderstood in the wider radiological protection community. Additionally, there wereexposure situations which were diﬃcult to categorise in this manner.
(n) The Commission now recognises three types of exposure situations which re-
place the previous categorisation into practices and interventions. These three expo-sure situations are intended to cover the entire range of exposure situations. Thethree situations are:
/C15Planned exposure situations, which are situations involving the planned introduc-
tion and operation of sources. (This type of exposure situation includes situationsthat were previously categorised as practices.)
/C15Emergency exposure situations, which are unexpected situations such as those that
may occur during the operation of a planned situation, or from a malicious act,
requiring urgent attention.ICRP Publication 103
13/C15Existing exposure situations, which are exposure situations that already exist when
a decision on control has to be taken, such as those caused by natural backgroundradiation.
(o) The three key principles of radiological protection are retained in the revised
Recommendations. The principles of justiﬁcation andoptimisation apply in all three
exposure situations whereas the principle of application of dose limits applies only for
doses expected to be incurred with certainty as a result of planned exposure situa-tions. These principles are deﬁned as follows:
/C15The Principle of Justiﬁcation : Any decision that alters the radiation exposure sit-
uation should do more good than harm.
/C15The Principle of Optimisation of Protection : The likelihood of incurring exposure,
the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses should
all be kept as low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and
societal factors.
/C15The Principle of Application of Dose Limits : The total dose to any individual from
regulated sources in planned exposure situations other than medical exposure ofpatients should not exceed the appropriate limits speciﬁed by the Commission.
The Commission continues to distinguish amongst three categories of exposure:
occupational exposures, public exposures, and medical exposures of patients (andcomforters, carers, and volunteers in research). If a female worker has declared thatshe is pregnant, additional controls have to be considered in order to attain a level ofprotection for the embryo/fetus broadly similar to that provided for members of thepublic.
(p) The revised Recommendations emphasise the key role of the principle of opti-
misation. This principle should be applied in the same manner in all exposure situ-
ations. Restrictions are applied to doses to a nominal individual (the ReferencePerson), namely dose constraints for planned exposure situations and reference levelsfor emergency and existing exposure situations. Options resulting in doses greater inmagnitude than such restrictions should be rejected at the planning stage. Impor-tantly, these restrictions on doses are applied prospectively, as with optimisationas a whole. If, following the implementation of an optimised protection strategy,it is subsequently shown that the value of the constraint or reference level is ex-
ceeded, the reasons should be investigated but this fact alone should not necessarily
prompt regulatory action. The Commission expects that this emphasis on a commonapproach to radiological protection in all exposure situations will aid application ofthe Commission’s Recommendations in the various circumstances of radiationexposure.
(q) The relevant national authorities will often play a major role in selecting values
for dose constraints and reference levels. Guidance on the selection process is pro-vided in the revised Recommendations. This guidance takes account of numerical
recommendations made previously by the Commission.
(r) Planned exposure situations encompass sources and situations that have been
appropriately managed within the Commission’s previous Recommendations forICRP Publication 103
14practices. Protection during the medical uses of radiation is also included in this type
of exposure situation. The process of planning protection in planned exposure situ-ations should include consideration of deviations from normal operating proceduresincluding accidents and malicious events. Exposures arising in such circumstancesare referred to by the Commission as potential exposures. Potential exposures are
not planned but they can be anticipated. The designer and the user of a source must
therefore take actions to reduce the likelihood of a potential exposure happening,such as assessing the probability of an event and introducing engineering safeguardscommensurate to this probability. Recommendations for planned exposure situa-tions are substantially unchanged from these provided in Publication 60 and subse-
quent publications. The dose limits for occupational and public exposures forpractices are retained for application to regulated sources in planned exposuresituations.
(s) Radiological protection in medicine includes the protection not only of patients
but also of individuals exposed to radiation whilst caring for or comforting patients,and volunteers involved in biomedical research. The protection of all of these groupsrequires special consideration. The Commission’s Recommendations for radiologicalprotection and safety in medicine are given in Publication 73 (ICRP 1996a) which has
been further elaborated in a series of publications. The recommendations, guidanceand advice in these publications remain valid and are summarised in the present Rec-ommendations and in Publication 105 (ICRP, 2007b) which was drafted by ICRP
Committee 3 to support these Recommendations.
(t) Emphasis on optimisation using reference levels in emergency and existing
exposure situations focuses attention on the residual level of dose remaining afterimplementation of protection strategies. This residual dose should be below the ref-erence level, which represents the total residual dose as a result of an emergency, orin an existing situation, that the regulator would plan not to exceed. These exposuresituations often involve multiple exposure pathways which means that protectionstrategies involving a number of diﬀerent protective actions will have to be consid-
ered. The process of optimisation will however continue to use the dose averted
by speciﬁc countermeasures as an important input into the development of optimisedstrategies.
(u) Emergency exposure situations include consideration of emergency prepared-
ness and emergency response. Emergency preparedness should include planning forthe implementation of optimised protection strategies which have the purpose ofreducing exposures, should the emergency occur, to below the selected value ofthe reference level. During emergency response, the reference level would act as a
benchmark for evaluating the eﬀectiveness of protective actions and as one input into
the need for establishing further actions.
(v) Existing exposure situations include naturally occurring exposures as well as
exposures from past events and accidents, and practices conducted outside the Com-mission’s Recommendations. In this type of situation, protection strategies will oftenbe implemented in an interactive, progressive manner over a number of years. In-door radon in dwellings and workplaces is an important existing exposure situationand is one where the Commission made speciﬁc recommendations in 1994 inICRP Publication 103
15Publication 65 (ICRP 1993b). Since then several epidemiological studies have con-
ﬁrmed the health risk from radon exposure and have generally provided supportfor the Commission’s Recommendations on protection against radon. Consistentwith its approach to radiological protection in the revised Recommendations, theCommission now recommends that national authorities should set national reference
levels as an aid to optimisation of protection against radon exposures. For the sake
of continuity and practicability, the Commission retains the upper value of 10 mSv(eﬀective dose, converted by convention from 600 Bq m
/C03Rn-222 in dwellings) for
the annual dose reference level, as given in Publication 65 . The Commission reaﬃrms
that radon exposure at work at levels above the national reference level should beconsidered part of occupational exposure whereas exposures at levels below shouldnot. Nevertheless, optimisation is a requirement below the national reference level.
(w) The revised Recommendations acknowledge the importance of protecting the
environment. The Commission has previously concerned itself with mankind’s envi-
ronment only with regard to the transfer of radionuclides through it, mainly in thecontext of planned exposure situations. In such situations, the Commission contin-ues to believe that the standards of environmental control needed to protect the gen-eral public would ensure that other species are not placed at risk. To provide a soundframework for environmental protection in all exposure situations, the Commissionproposes the use of Reference Animals and Plants. In order to establish a basis foracceptability, additional doses calculated to these reference organisms could be com-
pared with doses known to have speciﬁc biological eﬀects and with dose rates nor-
mally experienced in the natural environment. The Commission, however, doesnot propose to set any form of ‘dose limits’ for environmental protection.
(x) The Commission anticipates that although the revised Recommendations do
not contain any fundamental changes to the radiological protection policy, theseRecommendations will help to clarify application of the system of protection inthe plethora of exposure situations encountered, thereby further improving the al-ready high standards of protection.

Lifetime risk estimates
Several types of lifetime risk estimates can be used to calculate the risk, over a
lifetime, that an individual will develop, or die from, a speciﬁc disease causedby an exposure: 1) the excess lifetime risk (ELR) which is the diﬀerence betweenthe proportion of people who develop or die from the disease in an exposedpopulation and the corresponding proportion in a similar population withoutthe exposure; 2) the risk of exposure-induced death (REID) which is deﬁned asthe diﬀerence in a cause-speciﬁc death rate for exposed and unexposed popula-tions of a given sex and a given age at exposure, as an additional cause of death
introduced into a population; 3) loss of life expectancy (LLE) which describes
the decrease in life expectancy due to the exposure of interest; and 4) lifetimeattributable risk (LAR) which is an approximation of the REID and describesexcess deaths (or disease cases) over a follow-up period with population back-ground rates determined by the experience of unexposed individuals. The LARwas used in this report to estimate lifetime risks.

Nominal risk coefficient
Sex-averaged and age-at-exposure-averaged lifetime risk estimates for a repre-sentative population.
Non-cancer diseases
Somatic diseases other than cancer, e.g., cardiovascular disease and cataracts.
NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material)
Radioactive material containing no signiﬁcant amounts of radionuclides otherthan naturally occurring radionuclides. Material in which the activityICRP Publication 103
27concentrations of the naturally occurring radionuclides have been changed by
some process are included in NORM.
Occupational exposure
This refers to all exposure incurred by workers in the course of their work, with
the exception of
1) excluded exposures and exposures from exempt activities involving radiationor exempt sources; 2) any medical exposure; and 3) the normal local naturalbackground radiation.
Operating management
The person or group of persons that directs, controls, and assesses an organi-sation at the highest level. Many diﬀerent terms are used, including, e.g., chief
executive oﬃcer (CEO), director general (DG), managing director (MD), and
executive group.
Operational quantities
Quantities used in practical applications for monitoring and investigating situ-ations involving external exposure. They are deﬁned for measurements andassessment of doses in the body. In internal dosimetry, no operational dosequantities have been deﬁned which directly provide an assessment of equivalent
or eﬀective dose. Diﬀerent methods are applied to assess the equivalent or eﬀec-
tive dose due to radionuclides in the human body. They are mostly based onvarious activity measurements and the application of biokinetic models (com-putational models).
Optimisation of protection (and safety)
The process of determining what level of protection and safety makes expo-sures, and the probability and magnitude of potential exposures, as low as rea-
sonably achievable, economic and societal factors being taken into account.
Particle fluence, U
See ‘Fluence’.
Personal dose equivalent, H
pðdÞ
An operational quantity: the dose equivalent in soft tissue (commonly inter-preted as the ‘ICRU sphere’) at an appropriate depth, d, below a speciﬁed point
on the human body. The unit of personal dose equivalent is joule per kilogram
(J kg
/C01) and its special name is sievert (Sv). The speciﬁed point is usually given
by the position where the individual’s dosimeter is worn.
Planned exposure situations

that allow quantiﬁcation of the extent of exposure of the human body to ion-
ising radiation from both whole and partial body external irradiation and fromintakes of radionuclides.
Public exposure
Exposure incurred by members of the public from radiation sources, excludingany occupational or medical exposure and the normal local natural back-ground radiation.
Quality factor, QðLÞ
The factor characterising the biological eﬀectiveness of a radiation, based onthe ionisation density along the tracks of charged particles in tissue. Qis de-
ﬁned as a function of the unrestricted linear energy transfer, L
1(often denoted
asLor LET), of charged particles in water:ICRP Publication 103

Qhas been superseded by the radiation weighting factor in the deﬁnition of
equivalent dose, but it is still used in calculating the operational dose equivalentquantities used in monitoring.
Radiation detriment
A concept used to quantify the harmful health eﬀects of radiation exposure indiﬀerent parts of the body. It is deﬁned by the Commission as a function of sev-eral factors, including incidence of radiation-related cancer or heritable eﬀects,lethality of these conditions, quality of life, and years of life lost owing to theseconditions.
Radiation weighting factor, w
R
A dimensionless factor by which the organ or tissue absorbed dose is multiplied
to reﬂect the higher biological eﬀectiveness of high-LET radiations comparedwith low-LET radiations. It is used to derive the equivalent dose from the ab-sorbed dose averaged over a tissue or organ.
Radioactive material
Material designated in national law or by a regulatory body as being subject to
regulatory control because of its radioactivity, often taking account of both
activity and activity concentration.
Radiological attack
The use of radioactive or nuclear materials for malicious purposes, such asblackmail, murder, sabotage, or terrorism.
Random error
Errors that vary in a non-reproducible way. These errors can be treated statis-
tically by use of the laws of probability.
RBE
See ‘Relative biological eﬀectiveness’.
Reference Animals and Plants
A Reference Animal or Plant is a hypothetical entity, with the assumed basic
characteristics of a speciﬁc type of animal or plant, as described to the gener-
ality of the taxonomic level of Family, with deﬁned anatomical, physiological,and life-history properties, that can be used for the purposes of relating expo-sure to dose, and dose to eﬀects, for that type of living organism.ICRP Publication 103
30Reference Male and Reference Female (Reference Individual)
An idealised male or female with characteristics deﬁned by the Commission forthe purpose of radiological protection, and with the anatomical and physiolog-ical characteristics deﬁned in the report of the ICRP Task Group on ReferenceMan ( Publication 89 , ICRP 2002).
Reference Person
An idealised person for whom the organ or tissue equivalent doses are calcu-lated by averaging the corresponding doses of the Reference Male and Refer-ence Female. The equivalent doses of the Reference Person are used for thecalculation of the eﬀective dose by multiplying these doses by the correspond-ing tissue weighting factors.
Reference phantom
Voxel phantoms for the human body (male and female voxel phantoms basedon medical imaging data) with the anatomical and physiological characteristicsdeﬁned in the report of the ICRP Task Group on Reference Man ( Publication
89, ICRP 2002).
Reference value
The value of a parameter recommended by the Commission for use in a bioki-
netic model in the absence of more speciﬁc information, i.e., the exact value
used to calculate the dose coeﬃcients presented in the report. Reference valuesmay be speciﬁed to a greater degree of precision than that which would be cho-sen to reﬂect the uncertainty with which an experimental value is known, in or-der to avoid the accumulation of rounding errors in a calculation.
Reference level
In emergency or existing controllable exposure situations, this represents the le-
vel of dose or risk, above which it is judged to be inappropriate to plan to allow
exposures to occur, and below which optimisation of protection should beimplemented. The chosen value for a reference level will depend upon the pre-vailing circumstances of the exposure under consideration.
Relative biological effectiveness (RBE)
The ratio of a dose of a low-LET reference radiation to a dose of the radia-tion considered that gives an identical biological eﬀect. RBE values vary with
the dose, dose rate, and biological endpoint considered. In radiological
protection, the RBE for stochastic eﬀects at low doses (RBE
M) is of particular
interest.
Relative life lost
The ratio of the proportion of observed years of life lost among people dying ofa disease in an exposed population and the corresponding proportion in a sim-ilar population without the exposure.ICRP Publication 103
31REID
See ‘Lifetime risk estimates’.
Relative survival
The ratio of the proportion of cancer patients who survive for a speciﬁed num-
ber of years (e.g., 5 years) following diagnosis to the corresponding proportion
in a comparable set of cancer-free individuals.
Representative Person
An individual receiving a dose that is representative of the more highly exposedindividuals in the population (see Publication 101 , ICRP 2006a). This term is
the equivalent of, and replaces, ‘average member of the critical group’ de-scribed in previous ICRP Recommendations.
Residual dose
The dose expected to be incurred after protective measure(s) have beenfullyimplemented (or a decision has been taken not to implement any protectivemeasures).
Risk constraint
A prospective and source-related restriction on the individual risk (in the sense
of probability of detriment due to a potential exposure) from a source, which
provides a basic level of protection for the individuals most at risk from asource and serves as an upper bound on the individual risk in optimisationof protection for that source. This risk is a function of the probability of anunintended event causing a dose, and the probability of detriment due to thatdose. Risk constraints correspond to dose constraints but refer to potentialexposures.
Safety
The achievement of proper operating conditions, prevention of accidents, ormitigation of accident consequences.
Security
The prevention and detection of, and response to, theft, sabotage, unauthorisedaccess, illegal transfer, or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, otherradioactive substances, or their associated installations.
Sensitivity analysis
This aims to quantify how the results from a model depend upon the diﬀerentvariables included in it.
Sievert (Sv)
The special name for the SI unit of equivalent dose, eﬀective dose, and opera-tional dose quantities. The unit is joule per kilogram (J kg
/C01).ICRP Publication 103
32Source
An entity for which radiological protection can be optimised as an integralwhole, such as the x-ray equipment in a hospital, or the releases of radioactivematerials from an installation. Sources of radiation, such as radiation genera-tors and sealed radioactive materials, and, more generally, the cause of expo-
sure to radiation or to radionuclides.

radionuclide following its intake. The region may be an organ, a tissue, the con-tents of the gastrointestinal tract or urinary bladder, or the surfaces of tissuesas in the skeleton, the alimentary tract, and the respiratory tract.
Specific absorbed fraction
The fraction of energy of that emitted as a speciﬁed radiation type in a sourceregion, S, that is absorbed in 1 kg of a target tissue, T.
Statistical power
The probability that an epidemiological study will detect a given level of ele-vated risk with a speciﬁed degree of conﬁdence.
Stem cell
Non-diﬀerentiated, pluripotent cell, capable of unlimited cell division.
Stochastic effects of radiation
Malignant disease and heritable eﬀects for which the probability of an eﬀectoccurring, but not its severity, is regarded as a function of dose withoutthreshold.
Supervised area
A deﬁned area not designated as a controlled area but for which occupationalexposure conditions are kept under review, even though no speciﬁc protectionmeasures or safety provisions are normally needed.
Systematic error
Errors that are reproducible and tend to bias a result in one direction. Theircauses can be assigned, at least in principle, and they can have constant and
variable components. Generally these errors cannot be treated statistically.
Target region, T
i
Anatomical region within the body (reference phantom) in which radiation is
absorbed. The region may be an organ or a speciﬁed tissue as in the gastroin-testinal tract, urinary bladder, skeleton, and respiratory tract.ICRP Publication 103

341. INTRODUCTION
(1) This chapter deals with the history of the Commission and its Recommenda-
tions. It sets out the aims and form of this report and indicates why the Commissionconcerns itself only with protection against ionising radiation.
1.1. The history of the Commission
(2) The International Commission on Radiological Protection, hereafter called the
Commission, was established in 1928 by the International Congress of Radiology,with the name of the International X-Ray and Radium Protection Committee(IXRPC), following a decision by the Second International Congress of Radiology.In 1950 it was restructured and renamed as now.
(3) The Commission is an independent charity, i.e., a non-proﬁt-making organisa-
tion. The Commission works closely with its sister body, the International Commis-sion on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU), and has oﬃcial relationships
with the United Nations Scientiﬁc Committee on the Eﬀects of Atomic Radiation
(UNSCEAR), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It also has important relationships with the Inter-national Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP), and other United Nations bodies. Other organisations with which it worksinclude the Commission of the European Communities (‘European Commission’,EC), the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operationand Development (OECD/NEA), the International Organization for Standardiza-
tion (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The Commis-
sion also maintains contact with the professional radiological community through itsstrong links with the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA). TheCommission also takes account of progress reported by national organisations.
1.2. The development of the Commission’s Recommendations
(4) The ﬁrst general Recommendations of the Commission were issued in 1928 and
concerned the protection of the medical profession through the restriction of work-
ing hours with medical sources (IXRPC, 1928). This restriction is now estimated tocorrespond to an individual dose of about 1000 millisievert (mSv) per year. The earlyRecommendations were concerned with avoiding threshold eﬀects, initially in a qual-itative manner. A system of measurement of doses was needed before protectioncould be quantiﬁed and dose limits could be deﬁned. In 1934, Recommendationswere made implying the concept of a safe threshold about ten times the presentannual occupational dose limit (IXRPC, 1934). The tolerance idea continued and,
in 1951, the Commission proposed a limit that can now be estimated to be around
3 mSv per week for low-LET radiation (ICRP, 1951). By 1954 the support for athreshold was diminished because of the epidemiological evidence emerging of excessmalignant disease amongst American radiologists and the ﬁrst indication of excessleukaemia in the Japanese A-bomb survivors (ICRP, 1955).
35(5) The development of both the military and industrial uses of nuclear energy led
the Commission in the early 1950s to introduce recommendations for the protectionof the public. In the Commission’s 1956 Recommendations (ICRP, 1957), limits onweekly and accumulated doses were set that corresponded to annual dose limits of 50mSv for workers and 5 mSv for the public. Recognising the possibility of what are
now termed stochastic eﬀects, and the impossibility of demonstrating the existence
or non-existence of a threshold for these types of eﬀects, the Commission’s 1954 Rec-ommendations advised ‘ that every eﬀort [should] be made to reduce exposures to all
types of ionising radiation to the lowest possible level ’ (ICRP, 1955). This was succes-
sively formulated as the recommendation to maintain exposure ‘as low as practica-ble’ (ICRP, 1959), ‘as low as readily achievable’ (ICRP, 1966), and later on ‘as low asreasonably achievable, economic and social considerations being taken into account’(ICRP, 1973).
(6) The Commission’s ﬁrst report in the current series, numbered Publication 1
(1959), contained the Recommendations approved in 1958. Subsequent general Rec-ommendations have appeared as Publication 6 (1964), Publication 9 (1966), Publication
26(1977), and Publication 60 (1991b). These general Recommendations have been sup-
ported by many other Publications providing advice on more specialised topics.
(7) In Publication 26 , the Commission ﬁrst quantiﬁed the risks of stochastic eﬀects
of radiation and proposed a System of Dose Limitation (ICRP, 1977) with its threeprinciples of justiﬁcation, optimisation of protection, and individual dose limitation.
In 1990, the Commission largely revised the Recommendations partly because of
upward revisions of the estimates of risk from exposure to radiation, and partly toextend its philosophy to a System of Radiological Protection from the system of doselimitation (ICRP, 1991b). The principles of justiﬁcation, optimisation and individualdose limitation remained, and a distinction between ‘practices’ and ‘interventions’was introduced to take into account the diﬀerences in the various types of exposuresituations. Moreover, more emphasis was put on the optimisation of protection withconstraints so as to limit the inequity that is likely to result from inherent economic
and societal judgements.
(8) The annual dose limit of 50 mSv for workers
1set in 1956, was retained until
1990, when it was further reduced to 20 mSv per year on average based on the revi-sion of the risk for stochastic eﬀects estimated from the life-span study of the Hiro-shima–Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors (ICRP, 1991b). The annual dose limit of 5mSv for members of the public was reduced to 1 mSv per year on average in theCommission’s ‘Paris statement’ (ICRP, 1985b) and in Publication 60 (ICRP,
1991b) the dose limit was given as 1 mSv in a year with the possibility of averaging
over 5 years ‘in special circumstances’.
(9) Since Publication 60 , there has been a series of publications that have provided
additional guidance for the control of exposures from radiation sources (see the listof all references). When the 1990 Recommendations are included, these reports
1Some terms and units used in older reports have been converted to current terminology for
consistency.ICRP Publication 103
36specify some 30 diﬀerent numerical values for restrictions on individual dose for
diﬀering circumstances. Furthermore, these numerical values are justiﬁed in manydiﬀerent ways (ICRP, 2006b). In addition the Commission began to develop policyguidance for protection of the environment in Publication 91 (ICRP, 2003b).
(10) The Commission has now decided to adopt a revised set of Recommendations
while at the same time maintaining stability with the previous Recommendations.
(11) The Commission’s extensive review of the vast body of literature on the health
eﬀects of ionising radiation has not indicated that any fundamental changes areneeded to the system of radiological protection. There is, therefore, more continuitythan change in these Recommendations; some recommendations are to remain be-cause they work and are clear; others have been updated because understandinghas evolved; some items have been added because there has been a void; and someconcepts are better explained because more guidance is needed.
(12) The present Recommendations consolidate and add to previous Recommen-
dations issued in various ICRP publications. The existing numerical recommenda-tions in the policy guidance given since 1991 remain valid unless otherwise stated.Thus, these recommendations should not be interpreted as suggesting major changesto radiological protection regulations that are appropriately based on its previousRecommendations in Publication 60 and subsequent policy guidance. The Recom-
mendations reiterate and strengthen the importance of optimisation in radiologicalprotection and extend the successful experience in the implementation of this
requirement for practices (now included in planned exposure situations) to other sit-
uations, i.e., emergency and existing exposure situations.
(13) The Commission plans to follow up these Recommendations with reports
applying the process of optimisation in diﬀerent situations.
(14) These consolidated Recommendations are supported by a series of supporting
documents, which elaborate on important aspects of the Commission’s policy andunderpin the Recommendations:
/C15Low-dose extrapolation of radiation-related cancer risk ( Publication 99 , ICRP,
2005d).
/C15Biological and epidemiological information on health risks attributable to ionis-
ing radiation: A summary of judgements for the purposes of radiological protec-tion of humans (Annex A to these Recommendations).
/C15Quantities used in radiological protection (Annex B to these Recommendations).
/C15Optimisation of radiological protection (in Publication 101 , ICRP, 2006a, Part 2).
/C15Assessing dose to the Representative Person (in Publication 101 , ICRP, 2006a,
Part 1).
/C15A framework for assessing the impact of ionising radiation on the environment
(Publication 91 , ICRP, 2003b).
/C15In addition the Commission is providing guidance on the scope of radiological
protection ( Publication 104 , ICRP 2007a), and on radiological protection in med-
ical practice ( Publication 105 , ICRP 2007b).
(15) The principal objective of the Commission has been, and remains, the
achievement of the radiological protection of human beings. It has, nevertheless, pre-ICRP Publication 103
37viously regarded the potential impact on other species, although it has not made any
general statements about the protection of the environment as a whole. Indeed, inPublication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) the Commission stated that, at that time, it concerned
itself with mankind’s environment only with regard to the transfer of radionuclidesthrough the environment, because this directly aﬀects the radiological protection of
human beings. The Commission did, however, express the view that the standards of
environmental control needed to protect humans to the degree currently thoughtdesirable would ensure that other species are not put at risk.
(16) The Commission continues to believe that this is likely to be the case in gen-
eral terms under planned exposure situations (see Section 5.2 for the deﬁnition of
planned exposure situations), and that the human habitat has therefore been aﬀor-ded a fairly high degree of protection. There are, however, other environments toconsider, where the Commission’s Recommendations for protection of humans have
not been used or where humans are absent, and other exposure situations will arise
where environmental consequences may need to be taken into account. The Com-mission is also aware of the needs of some national authorities to demonstrate,directly and explicitly, that the environment is being protected even under plannedexposure situations. It therefore now believes that the development of a clearerframework is required in order to assess the relationships between exposure anddose, between dose and eﬀect, and the consequences of such eﬀects for non-humanspecies, on a common scientiﬁc basis. This is discussed further in Chapter 8.
(17) The advice of the Commission is aimed principally at regulatory authorities,
organisations, and individuals that have responsibility for radiological protection.The Commission’s Recommendations have helped in the past to provide a consistentbasis for national and regional regulatory standards, and the Commission has beenconcerned to maintain stability in its Recommendations. The Commission providesguidance on the fundamental principles on which appropriate radiological protec-tion can be based. It does not aim to provide regulatory texts. Nevertheless, it be-lieves that such texts should be developed from, and be broadly consistent with,
its guidance.
(18) There is a close connection between the Commission’s Recommendations and
the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiationand the Safety of Radiation Sources (usually simply called ‘the BSS’), which areco-sponsored by the relevant international organisations within the UN familyand issued by the IAEA. The governing body of the IAEA has decided that theBSS have to take the Commission’s Recommendations into account. The BSS there-fore have always followed the establishment of new Recommendations from the
Commission; for example, the 1977 and the 1990 ICRP Recommendations were
the basis for the revised International Basic Safety Standards published in 1982and 1996, respectively.
(19) These Recommendations, as in previous reports, are conﬁned to protection
against ionising radiation. The Commission recognises the importance of adequatecontrol over sources of non-ionising radiation. The International Commission onNon-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, provides recommendations concern-ing such sources (ICNIRP, 2004).ICRP Publication 103
381.2.1. The evolution of dose quantities and their units
(20) The ﬁrst dose unit, roentgen (r), was established for x rays in 1928 by the Inter-
national X-ray Unit Committee, which was later to become ICRU (IXRUC, 1928).The ﬁrst oﬃcial use of the term ‘dose’ together with an amended deﬁnition of the unit
r occurred in the 1937 recommendations of the ICRU (ICRU, 1938). The ICRU sug-
gested the concept of absorbed dose and oﬃcially deﬁned the name and its unit ‘rad’ in1953 to extend the concept of dose to certain materials other than air (ICRU, 1954).
(21) The ﬁrst dose quantity incorporating relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) of
diﬀerent types of radiation used by the ICRU was the ‘RBE dose in rems’, which was anRBE-weighted sum of absorbed dose in rads prescribed in the 1956 recommendationsof the ICRU. This dose quantity was replaced by the dose equivalent, a result of jointeﬀorts between the ICRU and the Commission, which was deﬁned by the product of
absorbed dose, quality factor of the radiation, dose distribution factor and other nec-
essary modifying factors (ICRU, 1962). The ‘rem’ was retained as the unit of doseequivalent. Furthermore, the ICRU deﬁned another dose quantity, kerma, and chan-ged the name of exposure dose to simple ‘exposure’ in its 1962 recommendations.
(22) In its 1977 Recommendations (ICRP, 1977), the Commission introduced a
new dose equivalent quantity for limitation of stochastic eﬀects by deﬁning a weightedsum of dose equivalents of various tissues and organs of the human body, where theweighting factor was named ‘tissue weighting factor’ (ICRP, 1977). The Commission
named this new weighted dose equivalent quantity ‘eﬀective dose equivalent’ at the
1978 Stockholm meeting (ICRP, 1978). At the same time, the SI units of dose wereadopted, replacing rad by gray (Gy) and rem by sievert (Sv).
(23) In its 1990 Recommendations (ICRP, 1991b), the Commission redeﬁned the
body-related dose quantities. For protection purposes, the absorbed dose averagedover a tissue or organ was deﬁned as the basic quantity. In addition, considering thatbiological eﬀects are not solely governed by the linear energy transfer, the Commis-sion decided to use ‘radiation weighting factors’, which were selected based on the
RBE in inducing stochastic eﬀects at low doses, instead of the quality factors used
in calculation of the dose equivalent of the 1977 Recommendations. To distinguishthe resulting quantity from the dose equivalent, the Commission named the newquantity ‘equivalent dose’. Accordingly, the eﬀective dose equivalent was renamed‘eﬀective dose’. There were some modiﬁcations in the tissue weighting factors to takeinto account the new information on health eﬀects of radiation.
(24) More details of the dosimetric quantities and their units currently in use
appear in Chapter 4.
1.3. Structure of the Recommendations
(25) Chapter 2 deals with the aims and the scope of the Recommendations. Chap-
ter 3 deals with biological aspects of radiation, and Chapter 4 discusses the quantities
and units used in radiological protection. Chapter 5 describes the conceptualframework of the system of radiological protection and Chapter 6 deals with theimplementation of the Commission’s Recommendations for the three diﬀerent typesICRP Publication 103
39of exposure situations. Chapter 7 describes the medical exposure of patients and
Chapter 8 discusses protection of the environment.

402. THE AIMS AND SCOPE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS
2.1. The aims of the Recommendations
(26) The primary aim of the Commission’s Recommendations is to contribute to
an appropriate level of protection for people and the environment against the detri-mental eﬀects of radiation exposure without unduly limiting the desirable human
actions that may be associated with such exposure.
(27) This aim cannot be achieved solely on the basis of scientiﬁc knowledge on
radiation exposure and its health eﬀects. It requires a model for protecting humansand the environment against radiation. The Recommendations are based on scien-tiﬁc knowledge and on expert judgement. Scientiﬁc data, such as those concerninghealth risks attributable to radiation exposure, are a necessary prerequisite, but soci-etal and economic aspects of protection have also to be considered. All of those con-cerned with radiological protection have to make value judgements about the
relative importance of diﬀerent kinds of risk and about the balancing of risks and
beneﬁts. In this, radiological protection is not diﬀerent from other ﬁelds concernedwith the control of hazards. The Commission believes that the basis for, and distinc-tion between, scientiﬁc estimations and value judgements should be made clearwhenever possible, so as to increase the transparency, and thus the understanding,of how decisions have been reached.
(28) Radiological protection deals with two types of harmful eﬀect. High doses will
cause deterministic eﬀects (harmful tissue reactions, see Chapter 3), often of an acute
nature, which only appear if the dose exceeds a threshold value. Both high and low
doses may cause stochastic eﬀects (cancer or heritable eﬀects), which may beobserved as a statistically detectable increase in the incidences of these eﬀects occur-ring long after exposure.
(29) The Commission’s system of radiological protection aims primarily to protect
human health. Its health objectives are relatively straightforward: to manage andcontrol exposures to ionising radiation so that deterministic eﬀects are prevented,and the risks of stochastic eﬀects are reduced to the extent reasonably achievable.
(30) In contrast, there is no simple or single universal deﬁnition of ‘environmental
protection’ and the concept diﬀers from country to country and from one circum-stance to another. Other ways of considering radiation eﬀects are therefore likelyto prove to be more useful for non-human species – such as those that cause earlymortality, or morbidity, or reduced reproductive success. The Commission’s aim isnow that of preventing or reducing the frequency of deleterious radiation eﬀectsto a level where they would have a negligible impact on the maintenance of biologicaldiversity, the conservation of species, or the health and status of natural habitats,
communities and ecosystems. In achieving this aim, however, the Commission recog-
nises that exposure to radiation is but one factor to consider, and is often likely to bea minor one. The Commission will give guidance and advice to ensure that itsapproach is commensurate with the level of risk, and compatible with eﬀorts beingmade to protect the environment from the impacts of other human activities.
412.2. The basis and structure of the system of protection
(31) Because of the variety of radiation exposure situations and of the need to
achieve a consistency across a wide range of applications, the Commission has estab-lished a formal system of radiological protection aimed at encouraging a feasible and
structured approach to protection. The system has to deal with a number of sources
of exposure, some already being in place, and others that may be introduced delib-erately as a matter of choice by society or as a result of emergencies. These sourcesare linked by a variety of interconnected events and situations leading to exposure ofindividuals, groups, or entire populations, both in the present and in the future. Thesystem of protection has been developed to allow this complex network to be treatedby a logical structure.
(32) The system of protection of humans is based on the use of a) reference
anatomical and physiological models of the human being for the assessment of
radiation doses, b) studies at the molecular and cellular level, c) experimental ani-mal studies, and d) epidemiological studies. The use of models has resulted in thederivation of tabulated, standardised data on the committed ‘dose per unit intake’of diﬀerent radionuclides for internal exposures and ‘dose per unit air kerma orﬂuence’ for external exposures of workers, patients, and the public. Epidemiolog-ical and experimental studies have resulted in the estimation of risks associatedwith the external and internal radiation exposure. For biological eﬀects, the data
come from human experience supported by experimental biology. For cancer and
heritable eﬀects, the Commission’s starting points are the results of epidemiolog-ical studies and of studies on animal and human genetics. These are supplementedby information from experimental studies on the mechanisms of carcinogenesisand heredity, in order to provide risk estimates at the low doses of interest inradiological protection.
(33) In view of the uncertainties surrounding the values of tissue weighting factors
and the estimate of detriment, the Commission considers it appropriate for radiolog-
ical protection purposes to use age- and sex-averaged tissue weighting factors and
numerical risk estimates. The system of protection is suﬃciently robust to achieveadequate protection for both sexes. Moreover, this obviates the requirement forsex- and age-speciﬁc radiological protection criteria which could prove unnecessarilydiscriminatory. However, for the purposes of retrospective evaluation of radiation-related risks, such as in epidemiological studies, it is appropriate to use sex- andage-speciﬁc data and calculate sex- and age-speciﬁc risks. The details of theCommission’s methods for calculating detriment are discussed in Annexes A and B.
(34) The Commission’s risk estimates are called ‘nominal’ because they relate to
the exposure of a nominal population of females and males with a typical age distri-bution and are computed by averaging over age groups and both sexes. The dosimet-ric quantity recommended for radiological protection, eﬀective dose, is alsocomputed by age- and sex-averaging. There are many uncertainties inherent in thedeﬁnition of nominal factors to assess eﬀective dose. The estimates of fatality anddetriment coeﬃcients are adequate for radiological protection purposes, but, as withall estimates derived from epidemiology, the nominal risk coeﬃcients do not apply toICRP Publication 103
42speciﬁc individuals. For the estimation of the likely consequences of an exposure of
an individual or a known population, it is necessary to use speciﬁc data relating tothe exposed individual.
(35) Situations in which the dose thresholds for deterministic eﬀects in relevant
organs could be exceeded should be subjected to protective actions under almost
any circumstances, as already recommended by the Commission (ICRP, 1999a). It
is prudent to take uncertainties in the current estimates of thresholds for determin-istic eﬀects into account, particularly in situations involving prolonged exposures.Consequently, annual doses rising towards 100 mSv will almost always justify theintroduction of protective actions.
(36) At radiation doses below around 100 mSv in a year, the increase in the inci-
dence of stochastic eﬀects is assumed by the Commission to occur with a small prob-ability and in proportion to the increase in radiation dose over the background dose.
Use of this so-called linear-non-threshold (LNT) model is considered by the Com-
mission to be the best practical approach to managing risk from radiation exposureand commensurate with the ‘precautionary principle’ (UNESCO, 2005). The Com-mission considers that the LNT model remains a prudent basis for radiological pro-tection at low doses and low dose rates (ICRP, 2005d).
(37) Even within a single class of exposure, an individual may be exposed by sev-
eral sources, so an assessment of the total exposure has to be attempted. This assess-ment is called ‘ individual-related ’. It is also necessary to consider the exposure of all
the individuals exposed by a source or group of sources. This procedure is called a
‘source-related ’ assessment. The Commission emphasises the primary importance of
source-related assessments, because action can be taken for a source to assure theprotection of individuals from that source.
(38) The probabilistic nature of stochastic eﬀects and the properties of the LNT
model make it impossible to derive a clear distinction between ‘safe’ and ‘dangerous’,and this creates some diﬃculties in explaining the control of radiation risks. The ma-jor policy implication of the LNT model is that some ﬁnite risk, however small, must
be assumed and a level of protection established based on what is deemed acceptable.
This leads to the Commission’s system of protection with its three fundamental prin-ciples of protection:
/C15Justiﬁcation.
/C15Optimisation of protection.
/C15Application of dose limits.
These principles are discussed in more detail in Section 5.6.
(39) In protecting individuals from the harmful eﬀects of ionising radiation, it is
the control (in the sense of restriction) of radiation doses that is important, no matterwhat the source.
(40) The principal components of the system of radiological protection can be
summarised as follows.
/C15A characterisation of the possible situations where radiation exposure may occur
(planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations).ICRP Publication 103
43/C15A classiﬁcation of the types of exposure (those that are certain to occur and
potential exposures, as well as occupational exposure, medical exposure ofpatients and public exposure).
/C15An identiﬁcation of the exposed individuals (workers, patients, and members of
the public).
/C15A categorisation of the types of assessment, namely source-related and individual-
related.
/C15A precise formulation of the principles of protection: justiﬁcation, optimisation of
protection, and application of dose limits.
/C15A description of the levels of individual doses that require protective action or
assessment (dose limits, dose constraints, and reference levels).
/C15A delineation of the conditions for the safety of radiation sources, inclu-
ding their security and the requirements for emergency preparedness and
response.
(41) The implementation of the system of radiological protection as described in
these Recommendations and summarised above should be monitored and assessed.Periodic reviews are important with a view to learning from experience and identify-ing any areas for improvement.
(42) In these Recommendations, the Commission uses the same conceptual
approach in the source-related protection, and emphasises the optimisation of pro-
tection regardless of the type of source, exposure situation, or exposed individual.
Source-related restrictions on doses or risks are applied during the optimisation ofprotection. In principle, protective options that imply doses above the level of suchrestrictions should be rejected. The Commission has previously used the term ‘con-straint’ for these restrictions for practices. For reasons of consistency, the Commis-sion will continue to use this term in the context of planned exposure situationsbecause such situations encompass the normal operation of practices. The Commis-sion recognises, however, that the word ‘constraint’ is interpreted in many languages
as a rigorous limit. Such a meaning was never the Commission’s intention, as their
application must depend upon local circumstances.
(43) Levels for protective action may be selected on the basis of generic consider-
ations including the Commission’s general Recommendations (see Table 8, Section6.5) or best practice. In any speciﬁc set of circumstances, particularly in an emer-gency or an existing exposure situation, it could be the case that no viable protectiveoption can immediately satisfy the level of protection selected from generic consid-erations. Thus interpreting a constraint rigorously as a form of limit could seriously
and adversely distort the outcome of an optimisation process. For this reason, in
emergency or existing exposure situations, the Commission proposes to use the term‘reference level’ for the restriction on dose or risk, above which it is judged to beinappropriate to plan to allow exposures to occur, and below which optimisationof protection should be implemented. The Commission wishes to emphasise, how-ever, that the diﬀerence in name between planned exposure situations and the othertwo exposure situations does not imply any fundamental diﬀerence in the applicationof the system of protection. Further guidance on the application of the optimisationICRP Publication 103
44principle in planned exposure situations, emergency exposure situations, and existing
exposure situations is provided in Chapter 6.
2.3. The scope of the Recommendations
(44) The Commission’s system of radiological protection applies to all radiation
exposures from any source, regardless of its size and origin. The term radiation is
used to mean ionising radiation. The Commission has been using the term radiation
exposure (orexposure in short) in a generic sense to mean the process of being
exposed to radiation or radionuclides, the signiﬁcance of exposure being determinedby the resulting radiation dose (ICRP, 1991b). The term ‘ source ’ is used to indicate
the cause of an exposure, and not necessarily a physical source of radiation (see Sec-tion 5.1). In general, for the purposes of applying the Recommendations, a source is
an entity for which radiological protection can be optimised as an integral whole.
(45) The Commission has aimed to make its Recommendations applicable as
widely and as consistently as possible. In particular, the Commission’s Recommen-dations cover exposures to both natural and man-made sources. The Recommenda-tions can apply in their entirety only to situations in which either the source ofexposure or the pathways leading to the doses received by individuals can be con-trolled by some reasonable means. Sources in such situations are called controllable
sources .
(46) There can be many sources, and some individuals may be exposed to radia-
tion from more than one of them. Provided that doses are below the threshold fordeterministic eﬀects (harmful tissue reactions), the presumed proportional relation-ship between the additional dose attributable to the situation and the correspondingincrease in the probability of stochastic eﬀects makes it possible to deal indepen-dently with each component of the total exposure and to select those componentsthat are important for radiological protection. Furthermore, it is possible to sub-divide these components into groups that are relevant to various purposes.
(47) The Commission has previously distinguished between practices that add
doses, and interventions that reduce doses (ICRP, 1991b). The Commission nowuses a situation-based approach to characterise the possible situations where radia-tion exposure may occur as planned, emergency ,a n d existing exposure situations ;i t
applies one set of fundamental principles of protection to all of these situations(see Section 5.6).
(48) The term ‘ practice ’ has, however, become widely used in radiological protec-
tion. The Commission will continue to use this term to denote an activity that causes
an increase in exposure to radiation or in the risk of exposure to radiation.
(49) Practices can be activities such as a business, trade, industry or any other pro-
ductive activity; it can also be a government undertaking, or a charity. It is implicit inthe concept of a practice that the radiation sources that it introduces or maintainscan be controlled directly by action on the source.
(50) The term ‘ intervention ’ has also become widely used in radiological protection
and has been incorporated into national and international standards to describesituations where actions are taken to reduce exposures. The Commission believesICRP Publication 103
45that it is more appropriate to limit the use of this term to describe protective actions
that reduce exposure, while the terms ‘emergency’ or ‘existing exposure’ will be usedto describe radiological exposure situations where such protective actions to reduce
exposures are required.
2.4. Exclusion and exemption
(51) The fact that the Commission’s Recommendations are concerned with any
level and type of radiation exposure does not mean that all exposures, all sources,and all human actions, can or need to be equally considered when establishing thelegal and regulatory systems for their application. Instead, a graded burden of obli-gation must be foreseen according to the amenability of a particular source or expo-sure situation to regulatory controls, and the level of exposure/risk associated with
that source or situation.
(52) There are two distinct concepts that delineate the extent of radiological pro-
tection control, namely (i) the exclusion of certain exposure situations from radiolog-ical protection legislation, usually on the basis that they are not amenable to controlwith regulatory instruments (cannot be regulated), and (ii) the exemption from someor all radiological protection regulatory requirements for situations where such con-trols are regarded as unwarranted, often on the basis that the eﬀort to control isjudged to be excessive compared to the associated risk (need not be regulated). A leg-
islative system for radiological protection should ﬁrst establish what should be with-
in the legal system and what should be outside it and therefore excluded from the lawand its regulations. Secondly, the system should also establish what could beexempted from some or all regulatory requirements because regulatory action isunwarranted. For this purpose, the legislative framework should permit the regula-tory authority to exempt situations from speciﬁed regulatory requirements, particu-larly from those of an administrative nature such as notiﬁcation and authorisation orexposure assessment and inspection. While exclusion is ﬁrmly related to deﬁning the
scope of the control system, it may not be suﬃcient as it is just one mechanism.
Exemption, on the other hand, relates to the power of regulatory authorities todetermine that a source or practice need not be subject to some or all aspects of reg-ulatory control. The distinction between exclusion and exemption is not absolute;regulatory authorities in diﬀerent countries may take diﬀerent decisions aboutwhether to exempt or exclude a speciﬁc source or situation.
(53) Exposures that may be excluded from radiological protection legislation in-
clude uncontrollable exposures and exposures that are essentially not amenable to
control regardless of their magnitude. Uncontrollable exposures are those that can-
not be restricted by regulatory action under any conceivable circumstance, such asexposure to the radionuclide potassium–40 incorporated into the human body.Exposures that are not amenable to control are those for which control is obviouslyimpractical, such as exposure to cosmic rays at ground level. The decision as to whatexposures are not amenable to control requires a judgment by the legislator, whichmay be inﬂuenced by cultural perceptions. For instance, national attitudes to the reg-ICRP Publication 103
46ulation of exposures to natural occurring radioactive materials are extremely
variable.
(54) Further guidance on exclusion and exemption is provided in Publication 104
(ICRP, 2007a).

473. BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION
(55) Most adverse health eﬀects of radiation exposure may be grouped in two gen-
eral categories:
/C15deterministic eﬀects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to the killing/ mal-
function of cells following high doses; and
/C15stochastic eﬀects, i.e., cancer and heritable eﬀects involving either cancer develop-
ment in exposed individuals owing to mutation of somatic cells or heritable dis-ease in their oﬀspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.
Consideration is also given to eﬀects on the embryo and fetus, and to diseases other
than cancer.
(56) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) the Commission classiﬁed the radiation eﬀects
that result in tissue reactions as deterministic eﬀects and used the term stochastic eﬀectsfor radiation-induced cancer and heritable disease. Eﬀects caused by injury in popula-tions of cells were called non-stochastic in Publication 41 (ICRP, 1984), and this was
replaced by the term deterministic, meaning ‘causally determined by preceding events’
inPublication 60 (ICRP, 1991b). The generic terms, deterministic and stochastic ef-
fects, are not always familiar to those outside the ﬁeld of radiological protection.For this and other reasons (given in Annex A), Chapter 3 and Annex A also use thedirectly descriptive terms tissue reactions and cancer/heritable eﬀects respectively.However, the Commission recognises that the generic terms, deterministic and sto-chastic eﬀects, have a ﬁrmly embedded use in its system of protection and will usethe generic and directly descriptive terms synonymously, according to context.
(57) In this respect the Commission notes that some radiation-associated health
consequences, particularly some non-cancer eﬀects (see Section 3.3), are not yet suf-ﬁciently well understood to assign to either of the generic categories. Since 1990, theCommission has reviewed many aspects of the biological eﬀects of radiation. Theviews developed by the Commission are summarised in this Chapter with emphasison eﬀective doses of up to about 100 mSv (or absorbed doses of about 100 mGy oflow-LET radiation) delivered as a single dose or accumulated annually. A more de-tailed summary of the post-1990 developments in radiation biology and epidemiol-
ogy is provided in Annex A and Publication 99 (ICRP, 2005d) together with
explanations of the judgements that underpin the recommendations made in thisChapter.
3.1. The induction of deterministic eﬀects (harmful tissue reactions)
(58) The induction of tissue reactions is generally characterised by a threshold
dose. The reason for the presence of this threshold dose is that radiation damage
(serious malfunction or death) of a critical population of cells in a given tissue needs
to be sustained before injury is expressed in a clinically relevant form. Above thethreshold dose the severity of the injury, including impairment of the capacity fortissue recovery, increases with dose.
49(59) Early (days to weeks) tissue reactions to radiation in cases where the threshold
dose has been exceeded may be of the inﬂammatory type resulting from the release ofcellular factors, or they may be reactions resulting from cell loss ( Publication 59 ,
ICRP, 1991a). Late tissue reactions (months to years) can be of the generic type ifthey arise as a direct result of damage to that tissue. By contrast other late reactions
may be of the consequential type if they arise as a result of early cellular damage
(Do¨rr and Hendry, 2001). Examples of these radiation-induced tissue reactions are
given in Annex A.
(60) Reviews of biological and clinical data have led to further development of the
Commission’s judgements on the cellular and tissue mechanisms that underlie tissuereactions and the dose thresholds that apply to major organs and tissues. However,in the absorbed dose range up to around 100 mGy (low LET or high LET) no tissuesare judged to express clinically relevant functional impairment. This judgement ap-
plies to both single acute doses and to situations where these low doses are experi-
enced in a protracted form as repeated annual exposures.
(61) Annex A provides updated information on dose thresholds (corresponding to
doses that result in about 1% incidence) for various organs and tissues. On the basisof current data the Commission judges that the occupational and public dose limits,including the limits on equivalent dose for the skin, hands/feet and eyes, given inPublication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) remain applicable for preventing the occurrence of
deterministic eﬀects (tissue reactions); see Section 5.10 and Table 6. However, new
data on the radiosensitivity of the eye are expected and the Commission will consider
these data when they become available. In addition, in Annex A, reference is made tothe clinical criteria that apply to dose limits on equivalent doses to the skin.
3.2. The induction of stochastic eﬀects
(62) In the case of cancer, epidemiological and experimental studies provide evi-
dence of radiation risk albeit with uncertainties at doses about 100 mSv or less. In
the case of heritable diseases, even though there is no direct evidence of radiation
risks to humans, experimental observations argue convincingly that such risks forfuture generations should be included in the system of protection.
3.2.1. Risk of cancer
(63) The accumulation of cellular and animal data relevant to radiation tumori-
genesis has, since 1990, strengthened the view that DNA damage response processes
in single cells are of critical importance to the development of cancer after radiation
exposure. These data, together with advances in knowledge of the cancer process ingeneral, give increased conﬁdence that detailed information on DNA damage re-sponse/repair and the induction of gene/chromosomal mutations can contribute sig-niﬁcantly to judgements on the radiation-associated increase in the incidence ofcancer at low doses. This knowledge also inﬂuences judgements on relative biologicalICRP Publication 103
50eﬀectiveness (RBE), radiation weighting factors, and dose and dose-rate eﬀects. Of
particular importance are the advances in understanding radiation eﬀects on DNAsuch as the induction of complex forms of DNA double strand breaks, the problemsexperienced by cells in correctly repairing these complex forms of DNA damage, andthe consequent appearance of gene/chromosomal mutations. Advances in microdos-
imetric knowledge concerning aspects of radiation-induced DNA damage have also
contributed signiﬁcantly to this understanding (see Annexes A and B).
(64) Although there are recognised exceptions, for the purposes of radiological
protection the Commission judges that the weight of evidence on fundamental cellu-lar processes coupled with dose-response data supports the view that, in the low doserange, below about 100 mSv, it is scientiﬁcally plausible to assume that the incidenceof cancer or heritable eﬀects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equiv-alent dose in the relevant organs and tissues.
(65) Therefore, the practical system of radiological protection recommended by
the Commission will continue to be based upon the assumption that at doses belowabout 100 mSv a given increment in dose will produce a directly proportionate incre-ment in the probability of incurring cancer or heritable eﬀects attributable to radia-tion. This dose-response model is generally known as ‘linear-non-threshold’ or LNT.This view accords with that given by UNSCEAR (2000). Other estimates have beenprovided by various national organisations, some in line with the UNSCEAR view(e.g., NCRP, 2001, NAS/NRC, 2006) while a report from the French Academies
(2005) argues in support of a practical threshold for radiation cancer risk. However,
from an analysis conducted by the Commission ( Publication 99 , ICRP, 2005d), the
Commission considers that the adoption of the LNT model combined with a judgedvalue of a dose and dose rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) provides a prudent basisfor the practical purposes of radiological protection, i.e., the management of risksfrom low-dose radiation exposure.
(66) However, the Commission emphasises that whilst the LNT model remains a
scientiﬁcally plausible element in its practical system of radiological protection, bio-
logical/epidemiological information that would unambiguously verify the hypothesis
that underpins the model is unlikely to be forthcoming (see also UNSCEAR, 2000,NCRP 2001). Because of this uncertainty on health eﬀects at low doses, the Commis-sion judges that it is not appropriate, for the purposes of public health planning, tocalculate the hypothetical number of cases of cancer or heritable disease that mightbe associated with very small radiation doses received by large numbers of peopleover very long periods of time (see also Sections 4.4.7 and 5.8).
(67) In arriving at its practical judgement on the LNT model, the Commission has
considered potential challenges associated with information on cellular adaptive
responses, the relative abundance of spontaneously arising and low-dose-inducedDNA damage and the existence of the post-irradiation cellular phenomena of inducedgenomic instability and bystander signalling ( Publication 99 , ICRP, 2005d). The
Commission recognises that these biological factors, together with possible tumour-promoting eﬀects of protracted irradiation, and immunological phenomena, mayinﬂuence radiation cancer risk (Streﬀer et al., 2004), but that current uncertaintiesICRP Publication 103
51on the mechanisms and tumorigenic consequences of the above processes are too great
for the development of practical judgements. The evidence is reviewed in Publication
99and in UNSCEAR (2008). The Commission also notes that since the estimation of
nominal cancer risk coeﬃcients is based upon direct human epidemiological data, anycontribution from these biological mechanisms would be included in that estimate.
Uncertainty with regard to the role of these processes in cancer risk will remain until
their relevance to cancer development in vivo is demonstrated and there is knowledgeof the dose dependence of the cellular mechanisms involved.
(68) Since 1990, further epidemiological information has accumulated on the risk
of organ-speciﬁc cancer following exposure to radiation. Much of this new informa-tion has come from the continuing follow-up of survivors of the atomic bomb explo-sions in Japan in 1945 – the Life Span Study (LSS). For cancer mortality (Prestonet al., 2003) the follow-up is 47 years (October 1950–December 1997); for cancer inci-
dence (Preston et al., 2007) the follow-up period is 41 years (January 1958 to Decem-
ber 1998). These latter data, which were not available in 1990, can provide morereliable estimates of risk principally because cancer incidence can allow for moreaccurate diagnosis. The Commission has therefore placed emphasis on incidencedata for its present Recommendations. In addition, epidemiological data from theLSS provide further information on the temporal and age-dependent pattern of radi-ation cancer risk, particularly the assessment of risk amongst those exposed at earlyages. Overall, current cancer risk estimates derived from the LSS are not greatly
changed since 1990, but the inclusion of the cancer incidence data provides a ﬁrmer
foundation for the risk modelling described in Annex A.
(69) The LSS is not, however, the sole source of information on radiation cancer
risk and the Commission has considered data from medical, occupational, and envi-ronmental studies (UNSCEAR, 2000, NAS/NRC, 2006). For cancers at some sitesthere is reasonable compatibility between the data from the LSS and those fromother sources. However, the Commission recognises that, for a number of organ/tis-sue risks and for overall risks, there are diﬀerences in radiation risk estimates among
the various data sets. Most studies on environmental radiation exposures currently
lack suﬃcient data on dosimetry and tumour ascertainment to contribute directlyto risk estimation by the Commission but may be a potentially valuable data sourcein the future.
(70) A dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) has been used by
UNSCEAR to project cancer risk determined at high doses and high dose rates tothe risks that would apply at low doses and low dose rates. In general, cancer riskat these low doses and low dose rates is judged, from a combination of epidemiolog-
ical, animal, and cellular data, to be reduced by the value of the factor ascribed to
DDREF. In its 1990 Recommendations the Commission made the broad judgementthat a DDREF of 2 should be applied for the general purposes of radiologicalprotection.
(71) In principle, epidemiological data on protracted exposure, such as those from
environmental and occupational circumstances, should be directly informative onjudgements of DDREF. However, the statistical precision aﬀorded by these studiesICRP Publication 103
52and other uncertainties associated with the inability to adequately control for con-
founding factors (see Annex A), do not allow for a precise estimate of DDREF atthis time. Accordingly the Commission has decided to continue to use broad judge-ments in its choice of DDREF based upon dose-response features of experimentaldata, the LSS, and the results of probabilistic uncertainty analysis conducted by oth-ers (NCRP, 1997, EPA, 1999, NCI/CDC, 2003, Annex A).
(72) The BEIR VII Committee (NAS/NRC, 2006) recently combined radiobiolog-
ical and epidemiological evidence concerning DDREF via a Bayesian statistical anal-
ysis. The data sets used were: a) solid cancer in the LSS; and b) cancer and life
shortening in animals. The modal value of DDREF from these analyses was 1.5 witha range of 1.1 to 2.3 and from this the BEIR VII Committee chose a value of 1.5. TheBEIR VII Committee recognised the subjective and probabilistic uncertainties inher-ent in their speciﬁc choice, and a DDREF of 2 remains compatible with the dataused and analyses conducted. Further to this, the Commission notes from AnnexA that, for the induction of gene and chromosomal mutations, values of DDREFgenerally fall in the range of 2–4, and for the induction of cancer in animals and life
shortening in animals, values of DDREF generally fall in the range of 2–3.
(73) In considering all the data noted above, and recognising the broad range of
experimental animal data showing reduction in carcinogenic eﬀectiveness andlife-shortening following protracted exposures, the Commission ﬁnds no compellingreason to change its 1990 recommendations of a DDREF of 2. However, the Com-mission emphasises that this continues to be a broad whole number judgement forthe practical purposes of radiological protection which embodies elements of uncer-tainty. This risk reduction factor of 2 is used by the Commission to derive the nominal
risk coeﬃcients for all cancers given in Table 1, but the Commission recognises that,
in reality, diﬀerent dose and dose rate eﬀects may well apply to diﬀerent organs/tissues.
3.2.2. Risk of heritable eﬀects
(74) There continues to be no direct evidence that exposure of parents to radiation
leads to excess heritable disease in oﬀspring. However, the Commission judges that
there is compelling evidence that radiation causes heritable eﬀects in experimental
animals. Therefore, the Commission prudently continues to include the risk of her-itable eﬀects in its system of radiological protection.Table 1. Detriment-adjusted nominal risk coeﬃcients (10/C02Sv/C01) for stochastic eﬀects after

53(75) The Commission also notes reports (reviewed in UNSCEAR, 2001) which
argue, on the basis of A-bomb survivor and mouse genetic data, that the risk of heri-table diseases tended to be overestimated in the past. There are some post-1990human and animal data on the quantitative aspects of radiation-induced germ cellmutation that impact on the Commission’s judgement on the risk of induction of
genetic disease expressing in future generations. There have also been substantial ad-
vances in the fundamental understanding of human genetic diseases and the processof germ line mutagenesis including that occurring after radiation. The Commissionhas reappraised the methodology used in Publication 60 for the estimation of heritable
risks including risks of multifactorial diseases ( Publication 83 , ICRP, 1999b).
(76) The Commission has now adopted a new framework for the estimation of her-
itable risks that employs data from human and mouse studies (UNSCEAR, 2001,NAS/NRC, 2006). Also, for the ﬁrst time, a scientiﬁcally justiﬁed method for the esti-
mation of risk of multifactorial disease has been included. Mouse studies continue to be
used to estimate genetic risks because of the lack of clear evidence in humans that germ-line mutations caused by radiation result in demonstrable genetic eﬀects in oﬀspring.
(77) The new approach to heritable risks continues to be based on the concept of
the doubling dose (DD) for disease-associated mutations used in Publication 60 .
However, the methodology diﬀers in that recoverability of mutations in live birthsis allowed for in the estimation of DD. An additional diﬀerence is that direct dataon spontaneous human mutation rates are used in conjunction with radiation-
induced mutation rates derived from mouse studies. This new methodology (see
Annex A, Box A.2) is based on the UNSCEAR 2001 report and has also been usedrecently by NAS/NRC (2006). In Publication 60 genetic risks were expressed at a
theoretical equilibrium between mutation and selection. In the light of furtherknowledge the Commission judges that many of the underlying assumptions in suchcalculations are no longer sustainable. The same view has been expressed byUNSCEAR (2001) and NAS/NRC (2006). Accordingly, the Commission now ex-presses genetic risks up to the second generation only.
(78) The Commission judges that this procedure will not lead to a signiﬁcant
underestimation of heritable eﬀects. This issue is discussed in UNSCEAR (2001)and in detail in Annex A where it is argued that there are no substantial diﬀerencesbetween genetic risks expressed at 2 and 10 generations.
(79) The Commission’s present estimate of genetic risks up to the second genera-
tion of about 0.2% per Gy is essentially the same as that cited by UNSCEAR (2001)(see Annex A and UNSCEAR 2001, Table 46). However, given the major changes inmethodology, the close similarity of the present second generation risk to that of
Publication 60 is coincidental. The present value relates to continuous low-dose-rate
exposures over these two generations.
3.2.3. Detriment-adjusted nominal risk coeﬃcients for cancer and heritable eﬀects
(80) New information on the risks of radiation-induced cancer and heritable eﬀects
has been used in risk modelling and disease detriment calculations in order to esti-mate sex-averaged nominal risk coeﬃcients.ICRP Publication 103
54(81) It remains the policy of the Commission that its recommended nominal risk
coeﬃcients should be applied to whole populations and not to individuals. TheCommission believes that this policy provides for a general system of protection thatis simple and suﬃciently robust. In retaining this policy the Commission does how-ever recognise that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in risk between males and females
(particularly for the breast) and in respect of age at exposure. Annex A provides data
and calculations relating to these diﬀerences.
(82) The calculation of sex-averaged nominal risk coeﬃcients for cancer involves
the estimation of nominal risks for diﬀerent organs and tissues, adjustment of theserisks for DDREF, lethality, and quality of life and, ﬁnally, the derivation of a set ofsite-speciﬁc values of relative detriment, which includes heritable eﬀects fromgonadal exposures. These relative detriments provide the basis of the Commission’ssystem of tissue weighting which is explained in Annex A (Box A.1) and summarised
in Chapter 4.
(83) On the basis of these calculations the Commission proposes nominal proba-
bility coeﬃcients for detriment-adjusted cancer risk as 5.5 10
/C02Sv/C01for the whole
population and 4.1 10/C02Sv/C01for adult workers. For heritable eﬀects, the detri-
ment-adjusted nominal risk in the whole population is estimated as 0.2 10/C02Sv/C01
and in adult workers as 0.1 10/C02Sv/C01. The most signiﬁcant change from Publication
60is the 6–8 fold reduction in the nominal risk coeﬃcient for heritable eﬀects. These
estimates are shown in Table 1, where they are compared with the estimates of det-
riment used in the 1990 Recommendations in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b). The re-
vised estimate of genetic risk has reduced the judged value of the tissue weightingfactor for the gonads considerably (see Chapter 4 and detailed arguments in AnnexA). However, the Commission emphasises that this reduction in the gonadal tissueweighting factor provides no justiﬁcation for allowing controllable gonadal expo-sures to increase in magnitude.
(84) The present nominal probability coeﬃcients for cancer shown in Table 1 have
been computed in a diﬀerent manner from that of Publication 60 . The present esti-
mate is based upon data on cancer incidence weighted for lethality and life impair-
ment, whereas in Publication 60 detriment was based upon fatal cancer risk weighted
for non-fatal cancer, relative life lost for fatal cancers and life impairment for non-fatal cancer.
(85) Note that, although all coeﬃcients in Table 1 are presented as fractional val-
ues, this presentation is used for the purposes of comparability to Annex A only anddoes not imply a level of precision (see paragraphs 81 and 82).
(86) In spite of changes in the cancer risk data and their treatment, the present
nominal risk coeﬃcients are wholly compatible with those presented by the Commis-
sion in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b). Given the uncertainties discussed in Annex A,
the Commission considers that the small diﬀerence in the estimate of nominal risksince 1990 is of no practical signiﬁcance.
(87) It is therefore the recommendation of the Commission that the approximated
overall fatal risk coeﬃcient of 5% per Sv on which current international radiationsafety standards are based continues to be appropriate for the purposes of radiolog-ical protection.ICRP Publication 103
553.2.4. Genetic susceptibility to cancer
(88) The issue of individual genetic diﬀerences in susceptibility to radiation-
induced cancer was noted in Publication 60 and reviewed in Publication 79 (ICRP,
1998a). Since 1990, there has been a remarkable expansion in knowledge of the var-
ious single gene human genetic disorders, where excess spontaneous cancer is ex-
pressed in a high proportion of gene carriers – the so-called high penetrance geneswhich can be strongly expressed as excess cancer. Studies with cultured human cellsand genetically altered laboratory rodents have also contributed much to knowledgeand, with more limited epidemiological and clinical data, suggest that most of therare single gene, cancer prone disorders will show greater-than-normal sensitivityto the tumorigenic eﬀects of radiation.
(89) There is also a growing recognition, with some limited supporting data, that
variant genes of lower penetrance through gene-gene and gene-environment interac-
tions can result in a highly variable expression of cancer following radiationexposure.
(90) On the basis of the data and judgements developed in Publication 79 and fur-
ther information reviewed in the UNSCEAR (2000, 2001) and NAS/NRC (2006) re-ports, the Commission believes that strongly expressing, high penetrance, cancergenes are too rare to cause signiﬁcant distortion of population-based estimates oflow-dose radiation cancer risk. Although the Commission recognises that variant
cancer genes of low penetrance may, in principle, be suﬃciently common to impact
upon population-based estimates of radiation cancer risk, the information availableis insuﬃcient to provide a meaningful quantitative judgement on this issue.
3.3. The induction of diseases other than cancer
(91) Since 1990 evidence has accumulated that the frequency of non-cancer dis-
eases is increased in some irradiated populations. The strongest statistical evidence
for the induction of these non-cancer eﬀects at eﬀective doses of the order of 1 Sv
derives from the most recent mortality analysis of the Japanese atomic bomb sur-vivors followed after 1968 (Preston et al., 2003). That study has strengthened thestatistical evidence for an association with dose – particularly for heart disease,stroke, digestive disorders, and respiratory disease. However, the Commission notescurrent uncertainties on the shape of the dose-response at low doses and that the LSSdata are consistent both with there being no dose threshold for risks of disease mor-tality and with there being a dose threshold of around 0.5 Sv. Additional evidence of
the non-cancer eﬀects of radiation, albeit at high doses, comes from studies of cancer
patients receiving radiotherapy but these data do not clarify the issue of a possibledose threshold (Annex A). It is also unclear what forms of cellular and tissue mech-anisms might underlie such a diverse set of non-cancer disorders.
(92) Whilst recognising the potential importance of the observations on non-
cancer diseases, the Commission judges that the data available do not allow for theirinclusion in the estimation of detriment following low radiation doses, less thanICRP Publication 103
56about 100 mSv. This agrees with the conclusion of UNSCEAR (2008), which found
little evidence of any excess risk below 1 Gy.
3.4. Radiation eﬀects in the embryo and fetus
(93) The risks of tissue reactions and malformation in the irradiated embryo and
fetus have been reviewed in Publication 90 (ICRP 2003a). In the main, this review
reinforced the judgements on in-utero risks given in Publication 60 although on some
issues new data allow for clariﬁcation of views. On the basis of Publication 90 , the
Commission has reached the following conclusions on the in-utero risks of tissueinjury and malformation at doses below about 100 mGy of low-LET radiation.
(94) The new data conﬁrm embryonic susceptibility to the lethal eﬀects of irradi-
ation in the pre-implantation period of embryonic developments. At doses under 100
mGy, such lethal eﬀects will be very infrequent.
(95) In respect of the induction of malformations, the new data strengthen the
view that there are gestational age-dependent patterns of in-utero radiosensitivitywith maximum sensitivity being expressed during the period of major organogenesis.On the basis of animal data it is judged that there is a true dose threshold of around100 mGy for the induction of malformations; therefore, for practical purposes, theCommission judges that risks of malformation after in-utero exposure to doses wellbelow 100 mGy are not expected.
(96) The Publication 90 (ICRP, 2003a) review of A-bomb survivor data on the
induction of severe mental retardation after irradiation in the most sensitive prenatalperiod (8–15 weeks post conception) supports a dose threshold of at least 300 mGyfor this eﬀect and therefore the absence of risk at low doses. The associated data onIQ losses estimated at around 25 points per Gy are more diﬃcult to interpret and thepossibility of a non-threshold dose response cannot be excluded. However, even inthe absence of a true dose threshold, any eﬀects on IQ following in-utero doses under100 mGy would be of no practical signiﬁcance. This judgement accords with that
developed in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b).
(97)Publication 90 also reviewed data concerning cancer risk following in-utero irra-
diation. The largest case-control studies of in-utero medical irradiation provided evi-dence of increased childhood cancer of all types. The Commission recognises that thereare particular uncertainties on the risk of radiation-induced solid cancers following in-utero exposure. The Commission considers that it is prudent to assume that life-timecancer risk following in-utero exposure will be similar to that following irradiation inearly childhood, i.e., at most, about three times that of the population as a whole.
3.5. Judgements and uncertainties
(98) Although the potential importance of synergistic eﬀects between radiation
and other agents is recognised by the Commission, at the present time there is noﬁrm evidence for such interactions at low doses that would justify a modiﬁcationof existing radiation risk estimates (UNSCEAR, 2000).ICRP Publication 103
57(99) Taking into account the information discussed in this Section, the practical
system of radiological protection recommended by the Commission will continueto be based upon the assumption that, at doses below about 100 mSv, a given incre-ment in dose will produce a directly proportionate increment in the probability ofincurring cancer or heritable eﬀects attributable to radiation. The Commission con-
siders that the continued application of the LNT model combined with a judged va-
lue of DDREF provides a prudent basis for practical purposes of radiologicalprotection, i.e., the management of risks from low-dose radiation exposure in pro-spective situations.

594. QUANTITIES USED IN RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION
4.1. Introduction
(100) Special dosimetric quantities have been developed for the assessment of doses
from radiation exposures. The fundamental protection quantities adopted by the
Commission are based on measures of the energy deposited in organs and tissuesof the human body. In order to relate the radiation dose to radiation risk (detri-ment), it is also necessary to take into account variations in the biological eﬀective-ness of radiations of diﬀerent quality as well as the varying sensitivity of organs andtissues to ionising radiation.
(101) In Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977) the protection quantities dose equivalent , for
organs and tissues of the human body, and eﬀective dose equivalent were introduced.
The deﬁnition and method of calculation of these quantities were modiﬁed in Pub-
lication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) to give the quantities equivalent dose and eﬀective dose .
The development of the quantities eﬀective dose equivalent and eﬀective dose hasmade a signiﬁcant contribution to radiological protection as it has enabled dosesto be summed from whole and partial body exposure from external radiation of var-ious types and from intakes of radionuclides.
(102) Equivalent dose and eﬀective dose cannot be measured directly in body tis-
sues. The protection system therefore includes operational quantities that can be mea-
sured and from which the equivalent dose and the eﬀective dose can be assessed.
(103) The general acceptance of eﬀective dose and the demonstration of its utility
in radiological protection are important reasons for maintaining it as the centralquantity for dose assessments in radiological protection. There are, however, a num-ber of aspects of the dosimetry system given in Publication 60 that need to be
addressed and clariﬁed as summarised below and given in more detail in Annex B.Care is also needed in describing the situations in which eﬀective dose should andshould not be used. In some situations, tissue absorbed dose or equivalent dose
are more appropriate quantities.
4.2. Considerations of health eﬀects
(104) Radiological protection in the low dose range is primarily concerned with
protection against radiation-induced cancer and heritable disease. These eﬀects aretaken to be probabilistic in nature, with no threshold, and to increase in frequencyin proportion to the radiation dose (see Chapter 3 and Annex A). In the deﬁnition
and calculation of eﬀective dose the recommended radiation weighting factors, w
R,
allow for the diﬀerences in the eﬀect of various radiations in causing stochastic eﬀectswhile tissue weighting factors, w
T, allow for the variations in radiation sensitivity of
diﬀerent organs and tissues to the induction of stochastic eﬀects (see Section 4.3.4and Annex B). The radiation weighting factors for radiations characterised by a highlinear energy transfer, so-called high-LET radiations (see Section 4.3.3), are derivedfor stochastic eﬀects at low doses.
61(105) At high doses, and especially in emergency situations, radiation exposures
may cause deterministic eﬀects (tissue reactions). Such clinically observable damageoccurs above threshold doses. The extent of damage depends upon the absorbeddose and dose rate as well as radiation quality (see Annexes A and B) and the sen-sitivity of the tissue. In general, values of relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) for
tissue reactions caused by high-LET radiations are found to be lower than those ob-
tained for stochastic eﬀects at low doses, and the relative sensitivity of tissues alsodiﬀers. The quantities equivalent dose and eﬀective dose should not be used to quan-tify higher radiation doses or to make decisions on the need for any treatment relatedto tissue reactions. For such purposes, doses should be evaluated in terms of ab-sorbed dose (in gray, Gy), and where high-LET radiations (e.g., neutrons or alphaparticles) are involved, an absorbed dose, weighted with an appropriate RBE, shouldbe used (see Annex B).
4.3. Dose quantities
(106) The procedure for the assessment of eﬀective dose adopted by the Commis-
sion is to use absorbed dose as the fundamental physical quantity, to average it over
speciﬁed organs and tissues, to apply suitably chosen weighting factors to take ac-count of diﬀerences in biological eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent radiations to give the quan-tity equivalent dose, and to consider diﬀerences in sensitivities of organs and tissues
to stochastic health eﬀects. Values of the equivalent dose to organs and tissues
weighted for the radiosensitivity of these organs and tissues are then summed to givethe eﬀective dose. This quantity is based on the exposure to radiation from externalradiation ﬁelds and from incorporated radionuclides as well as on the primary phys-ical interactions in human tissues and on judgements about the biological reactionsresulting in stochastic health eﬀects (Annex B).
4.3.1. Absorbed dose
(107) In radiation biology, clinical radiology, and radiological protection the ab-
sorbed dose, D, is the basic physical dose quantity, and it is used for all types of ion-
ising radiation and any irradiation geometry. It is deﬁned as the quotient of d /C22eby
dm, where d /C22eis the mean energy imparted to matter of mass d mby ionising radia-
tion, that is
D¼
d/C22e
dmð4:1Þ
(108) The SI unit of absorbed dose is J kg/C01and its special name is gray (Gy).
Absorbed dose is derived from the mean value of the stochastic quantity of energy im-parted, e, and does not reﬂect the random ﬂuctuations of the interaction events in tis-
sue. While it is deﬁned at any point in matter, its value is obtained as an average over a
mass element d mand hence over many atoms or molecules of matter. Absorbed dose
is a measurable quantity and primary standards exist to determine its value.ICRP Publication 103
62The deﬁnition of absorbed dose has the scientiﬁc rigour required for a basic physical
quantity (Annex B).
4.3.2. Averaging of dose
(109) When using the quantity absorbed dose in practical protection applications,
doses are averaged over tissue volumes. It is assumed that, for low doses, the meanvalue of absorbed dose averaged over a speciﬁc organ or tissue can be correlatedwith radiation detriment for stochastic eﬀects in that tissue with an accuracy suﬃ-cient for the purposes of radiological protection. The averaging of absorbed dosesin tissues or organs and the summing of weighted mean doses in diﬀerent organsand tissues of the human body comprise the basis for the deﬁnition of the protectionquantities which are used for limiting stochastic eﬀects at low doses. This approach is
based on the LNT model and therefore allows the addition of doses resulting from
external and internal exposure.
(110) The averaging of absorbed dose is carried out over the mass of a speciﬁed
organ (e.g., liver) or tissue (e.g., muscle) or the sensitive region of a tissue (e.g., end-osteal surfaces of the skeleton). The extent to which the mean dose value is represen-tative of the absorbed dose in all regions of the organs, tissues or tissue regionsdepends, for external irradiation, on the homogeneity of the exposure and on therange of the radiation incident on the body. The homogeneity of the dose distribu-
tion in the low dose range depends also upon microdosimetric properties. For radi-
ations with low penetration or limited range (e.g., low-energy photons or chargedparticles) as well as for widely distributed tissues and organs (e.g., red bone marrow,lymphatic nodes, or skin) the absorbed dose distribution within the speciﬁed organor tissue will be even more heterogeneous. In cases of extreme partial body exposure,tissue damage may occur even if the mean organ or tissue dose or the eﬀective dose isbelow the dose limit. A special limit on local skin dose, for example, takes account ofthis situation in the case of exposure by low-penetrating radiation.
(111) The absorbed dose distribution in organs from radiations emitted by radio-
nuclides retained within body organs or tissues, so-called internal emitters, dependson the penetration and range of the emitted radiations. Thus, the absorbed dose dis-tribution for radionuclides emitting alpha particles, soft beta particles, low-energyphotons, or Auger electrons may be highly heterogeneous (see Annex B). This het-erogeneity applies in particular to radionuclides in the respiratory and alimentarysystems, and the skeleton. Speciﬁc dosimetric models have been developed to takeaccount of such heterogeneity in the distribution and retention of activity and of sen-
sitive regions in these particular cases.
4.3.3. Equivalent dose and radiation weighting factors
(112) The protection quantities are used to specify exposure limits to ensure that
the occurrence of stochastic health eﬀects is kept below unacceptable levels and thattissue reactions are avoided. The deﬁnition of the protection quantities is based onICRP Publication 103
63the average absorbed dose, DT,Rin the volume of a speciﬁed organ or tissue T (see
Table 3), due to radiation of type R (see Table 2). The radiation Ris given by the
type and energy of radiation either incident on the body or emitted by radionuclidesresiding within it. The protection quantity equivalent dose in an organ or tissue, H
T,
is then deﬁned by
HT¼X
RwRDT;R ð4:2Þ
where wRis the radiation weighting factor for radiation R. The sum is performed
over all types of radiations involved. The unit of equivalent dose is J kg/C01and
has the special name sievert (Sv).
(113) In the early 1960s, radiation weighting in the deﬁnition of radiological pro-
tection quantities was related to the radiation quality factor, Q, as a function of LET
and denoted as Lin the Q(L) function of Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977). In Publication
60(ICRP, 1991b) the method of radiation weighting was changed in the calculation
of the protection quantities equivalent dose and eﬀective dose. The Commission
selected a general set of radiation weighting factors ( wR) that were considered to
be appropriate for application in radiological protection. The values of wRwere
deﬁned largely on the basis of the relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) of the dif-ferent radiations.
(114) A revised set of w
Rvalues has been adopted in these Recommendations
based upon a re-evaluation of the available data (see Annexes A and B). The valuesofw
Rfor neutrons and protons given in these Recommendations diﬀer from those
given in Publication 60 (see below and Annex B). A wRvalue for charged pions
has been included. The value of wRfor photons is the same for x rays and gamma
rays of all energies. The numerical values of wRare speciﬁed in terms of type and,
in the case of neutrons, in terms of energy of radiation either incident on the humanbody or emitted by radionuclides residing in the body (Table 2). The values of w

64selected by judgement on the basis of a broad range of experimental RBE data which
are relevant to stochastic eﬀects. The RBE values increase to a maximum (RBE M)
with decreasing radiation dose (ICRP, 2003c). Values of RBE Mhave been used
forwRselection, and ﬁxed values are assigned to these wRfactors for radiological
protection purposes.
(115) Reference radiation. Values of RBE obtained experimentally depend on the
reference radiation chosen. Generally, low-LET photon radiation is taken as thereference, although no speciﬁc energy has been agreed upon for this purpose. When
radiation weighting factors were selected for Publication 60 , a broad range of
experimental RBE data using either high energy x rays above about 200 kV orcobalt–60 or caesium–137 gamma radiation was considered (see Annex B). Thisapproach is also used in these Recommendations, although it should be recognisedthat experimentally diﬀerent RBE values can result depending upon the choice of thereference radiation between x rays and higher energy gamma radiation (e.g., cobalt–60). Such diﬀerences have been established mainly in studies on cells in vitro (seeAnnex B).

with LET values of less than 10 keV/ lm. These radiations have always been given a
radiation weighting of 1. There are good arguments (see Annex B) to continue to useaw
Rof 1 for all low-LET radiations (Annex B, Table 3). This does not, however,
imply that there are no diﬀerences in radiation quality of photons of diﬀerent ener-gies. The proposed simpliﬁcation is suﬃcient only for the intended application ofequivalent dose and eﬀective dose, e.g., for dose limitation and assessment and con-trol of doses in the low-dose range. In cases where individual retrospective risk
assessments have to be made, more detailed information on the radiation ﬁeld and
appropriate RBE values may need to be considered if relevant data are available.Heterogeneity of the radiation dose within cells, as can occur with tritium or Augeremitters incorporated into DNA, may also require speciﬁc analysis (see Annex B).Equivalent dose and eﬀective dose are not appropriate quantities for use in suchassessments (see Section 4.4.6).Table 3.

65(117) Neutrons. The radiation weighting factor for neutrons reﬂects their relative
biological eﬀectiveness following external exposure. The biological eﬀectiveness ofneutrons incident on the human body is strongly dependent on neutron energy
(see Annex B).
(118) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), the radiation weighting factor for neutrons
was deﬁned by a step function. It is now recommended that the radiation weightingfactor for neutrons be deﬁned by a continuous function (Fig. 1). It should be noted,however, that the use of a continuous function is based on the practical consider-ation that most neutron exposures involve a range of energies. The recommendationof the function does not imply a higher precision of the basic data. A detailed discus-sion on the selection of the w
Rfunction for neutrons is given in Annex B. The most
signiﬁcant changes compared to the data in Publication 60 are the decrease of wRin
the low-energy range, which takes account of the large contribution of secondaryphotons to the absorbed dose in the human body, and the decrease of w
Rat neutron
energies above 100 MeV. The following continuous function in neutron energy, En
(MeV), is recommended for the calculation of radiation weighting factors for
neutrons:
wR¼2:5þ18:2e/C0½lnðEnÞ/C1382=6; En<1 MeV

This function, i.e., Eq. (4.3) and Fig. 1, has been derived empirically and is consistent
with existing biological and physical knowledge (Annex B).

66(119) Protons and pions. When considering exposure to protons, only external
radiation sources are of importance in practical radiological protection. In the pro-ton component of cosmic radiation ﬁelds or ﬁelds near high-energy particle acceler-ators, very high-energy protons dominate. Protons with energies of a few MeV are ofminor signiﬁcance even when their increased biological eﬀectiveness at low energies
is taken into account. It is judged to be suﬃciently accurate for radiological protec-
tion purposes to adopt a single w
Rvalue for protons of all energies that is mainly
based on radiobiological data for high-energy protons above 10 MeV. The rangeof 10 MeV protons in tissue is 1.2 mm and decreases with lower energies. These pro-tons will be absorbed in skin. (Annex B). A single radiation weighting factor of 2 isrecommended for external proton radiation for general use (ICRP, 2003c). It re-places the value of 5 recommended in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b).
(120) Pions are negatively or positively charged or neutral particles encountered in
radiation ﬁelds resulting from interactions of primary cosmic rays with nuclei at high
altitudes in the atmosphere. These particles contribute to exposures in aircraft. Theyare also found as part of the complex radiation ﬁelds behind shielding of high-energyparticle accelerators and thus contribute to the occupational exposure of acceleratorstaﬀ. Considering that the energy distribution of pions in radiation ﬁelds is verybroad, the use of a single weighting factor of 2 is recommended for all charged pions.
(121) Alpha particles. Humans may be exposed to alpha particles from internal
emitters, e.g., from inhaled radon progeny or ingested alpha-emitting radionuclides
such as isotopes of plutonium, polonium, radium, thorium, and uranium. A number
of epidemiological studies, as well as animal data, provide information on the riskfrom incorporated alpha emitters. However, the distribution of radionuclides inorgans and tissues is complex and the estimation of dose depends on the modelsused. Hence the calculated doses are associated with substantial uncertainties andresult in a broad range of RBE values from epidemiological as well as experimentalstudies (ICRP, 2003c, and Annex B).
(122) Despite substantial uncertainties in estimates of dose and risk from intakes
of alpha-emitting radionuclides, the available human and animal data indicate that
the RBE depends on the biological end-point under consideration. The limitedhuman data that allow estimation of alpha particle RBE values suggest values ofaround 10–20 for lung and liver cancer and lower values for bone cancer and leukae-mia. Judgements on the available data and the selection of a w
Rvalue for alpha par-
ticles have been reviewed in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c). As recent data do not
provide compelling evidence for a change of the radiation weighting factor for alphaparticles, the w
Rvalue of 20 adopted in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) is retained.
(123) Fission fragments and heavy ions. Doses from ﬁssion fragments are of impor-
tance in radiological protection, mainly in internal dosimetry, and the situationregarding radiation weighting factors is similar to that for alpha particles. The shortranges of heavy ions and ﬁssion fragments in organs and tissues and the resultingionisation density have a strong inﬂuence on their biological eﬀectiveness. A radia-tion weighting factor of 20 (see Table 2), which equals that for alpha particles, is rec-ommended (see Annex B).ICRP Publication 103
67(124) Heavy ions are encountered in external radiation ﬁelds in aviation at high
altitudes and in space exploration. Data on RBE for heavy ions are very limitedand mostly based on in vitro experiments. The radiation quality of heavy chargedparticles incident on and stopped in the human body changes markedly along thetrack of the particle. The selection of a single w
Rvalue of 20 for all types and energies
of heavy charged particles is a conservative estimate and is recommended as suﬃ-
cient for general application in radiological protection. For applications in space,where these particles contribute signiﬁcantly to the total dose in the human body,a more realistic approach may have to be used.
4.3.4. Eﬀective dose and tissue weighting factors
(125) The eﬀective dose, E, introduced in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) is deﬁned
by a weighted sum of tissue equivalent doses as:
E¼X
TwTHT¼X
TwTX
RwRDT;R ð4:4Þ
where wTis the tissue weighting factor for tissue T and RwT= 1. The sum is per-
formed over all organs and tissues of the human body considered to be sensitiveto the induction of stochastic eﬀects. These w
Tvalues are chosen to represent the
contributions of individual organs and tissues to overall radiation detriment from
stochastic eﬀects. The unit of eﬀective dose is J kg/C01with the special name sievert
(Sv). The unit is the same for equivalent dose and eﬀective dose as well as for someoperational dose quantities (see Section 4.3.7). Care must be taken to ensure that thequantity being used is clearly stated.
(126) The organs and tissues for which w
Tvalues are speciﬁed are given in Table 3
(see also Annex A).
(127) On the basis of epidemiological studies on cancer induction in exposed pop-
ulations, and risk assessments for heritable eﬀects, a set of wTvalues was chosen for
these Recommendations (Table 3) based on the respective values of relative radiationdetriment (see Table 5 in Annex A). They represent mean values for humans aver-aged over both sexes and all ages and thus do not relate to the characteristics of par-ticular individuals.
(128) The w
Tfor the remainder tissues (0.12) applies to the arithmetic mean dose
of the 13 organs and tissues for each sex listed in the footnote to Table 3. The so-called splitting rule in the treatment of the remainder in Publication 60 (ICRP,
1991b) is no longer used and hence the eﬀective dose is additive.
4.3.5. Determination of eﬀective dose
Reference phantoms
(129) The quantities equivalent dose and eﬀective dose are not measurable in prac-
tice. For occupational exposures, their values are determined by radiation monitoringusing operational quantities (see Section 4.3.6). For the calculation of conversion coef-
ﬁcients for external exposure, computational phantoms are used for dose assessment inICRP Publication 103
68various radiation ﬁelds. For the calculation of dose coeﬃcients from intakes of radio-
nuclides, biokinetic models for radionuclides, reference physiological data, and com-putational phantoms are used (see Annex B).
(130) The evaluation of equivalent doses for the Reference Male and Female and of
eﬀective dose for the Reference Person is based on the use of anthropomorphic mod-
els (phantoms). In the past, the Commission did not specify a particular phantom,
and in fact various mathematical phantoms such as hermaphrodite MIRD-typephantoms (Snyder et al., 1969), the sex-speciﬁc models of Kramer et al. (1982), orthe age-speciﬁc phantoms of Cristy and Eckerman (1987) have been used. The Com-mission now uses reference computational phantoms of the adult Reference Male andadult Reference Female for the calculation of equivalent doses for organs and tissues(Fig. 2). The phantoms are based on medical tomographic images (Zankl et al., 2005).They are made up of three-dimensional volume pixels (voxels). The voxels that make
up deﬁned organs have been adjusted to approximate the organ masses assigned to
the Reference Male and Reference Female in Publication 89 (ICRP, 2002). In order
to provide a practicable approach for the assessment of equivalent doses and eﬀectivedose, conversion coeﬃcients relating to physical quantities, e.g., particle ﬂuence or airkerma for external exposure and activity intake for internal exposure, are calculatedfor standard exposure conditions for the reference phantoms.
(131) These models are computational representations of the Reference Male and
Reference Female, and are used to compute the mean absorbed dose, D
T, in an organ
or tissue T, from reference radiation ﬁelds external to the body and from decay of
radionuclides after incorporation. They are used for calculations of dose conversioncoeﬃcients for external radiation ﬁelds and dose coeﬃcients for the intake of radionuc-lides (see Annex B). These organ and tissue doses are multiplied with the radiationweighting factor to yield the equivalent doses in the tissues and organs of the ReferenceMale and the Reference Female (see Fig. 2). Reference computational phantoms willalso be developed for children of diﬀerent ages and for the pregnant woman and fetus.
Sex averaging for eﬀective dose
(132) For the purposes of radiological protection, it is useful to apply a single
value of eﬀective dose for both sexes (see paragraph 33). The tissue weighting factorsof Table 3 are sex- and age-averaged values for all organs and tissues, including themale and female breast, testis, and ovary (gonads: carcinogenic and heritable eﬀects).This averaging implies that the application of this approach is restricted to the deter-mination of eﬀective dose in radiological protection and, in particular, cannot beused for the assessment of individual risk. The eﬀective dose is then computed fromthe equivalent doses assessed for organ or tissue T of the Reference Male, H
M
T, and
Reference Female, HF
T, according to the following equation (see also Annex B):
E¼X
TwTHM
TþHF
T
2/C20/C21
ð4:5Þ
(133) Analogous to the approach for other organs and tissues, the equivalent dose
to the remainder is deﬁned separately for the Reference Male and the Reference
Female and these values are included in Eq. (4.5) – see Fig. 2. The equivalent doseICRP Publication 103
69to the remainder tissues is computed as the arithmetic mean of the equivalent doses
to the tissues listed in the footnote to Table 3. The equivalent doses to the remain-
der tissues of the Reference Male, HM
rmd, and the Reference Female, HF
rmd, are com-
puted as

T: ð4:6Þ
where T is a remainder tissue from Table 3. The summation in Eqn. (4.5) extends
over the equivalent dose to remainder tissues in the Reference Male and the Refer-ence Female (Annex B).
(134) The eﬀective dose for protection purposes is based on the mean doses in
organs or tissues of the human body. It is deﬁned and estimated in a ReferencePerson (see Fig. 2). This quantity provides a value which takes account of the
given exposure conditions but not of the characteristics of a speciﬁc individual. In
particular, the tissue weighting factors are mean values representing an averageover many individuals of both sexes. The equivalent doses in the organs and tissuesof the Reference Male and the Reference Female are averaged (Eqn. 4.5). The aver-aged dose is multiplied with the corresponding tissue weighting factor. The sum ofthese products yields the sex-averaged eﬀective dose for the Reference Person(Fig. 2).
4.3.6. Operational quantities
(135) The body-related protection quantities, equivalent dose and eﬀective dose,
are not measurable in practice. Therefore, operational quantities are used for theMale phantom

70assessment of eﬀective dose or mean equivalent doses in tissues or organs. These
quantities aim to provide a conservative estimate for the value of the protectionquantities related to an exposure, or potential exposure, of persons under most irra-diation conditions. They are often used in practical regulations or guidance. Diﬀer-ent types of operational quantities are used for internal and external exposures as
summarised below. More details are given in Annex B.
(136) Operational quantities for area and individual monitoring of external expo-
sures have been deﬁned by ICRU (see Annex B). The operational quantities for areamonitoring are the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10) and the directional dose equiv-
alent, H
0(0.07, X). The operational quantity for individual monitoring is the personal
dose equivalent, Hp(d), which is the dose equivalent in ICRU (soft) tissue at an
appropriate depth, d, below a speciﬁed point on the human body. The speciﬁed point
is normally taken to be where the individual dosimeter is worn. For the assessment of
eﬀective dose, Hp(10) with a depth d= 10 mm is chosen, and for the assessment of
the dose to the skin and to the hands and feet the personal dose equivalent,H
p(0.07), with a depth d= 0.07 mm, is used. A depth d= 3 mm has been proposed
for the rare case of monitoring the dose to the lens of the eye. In practice, however,H
p(3) has rarely been monitored and Hp(0.07) can be used for the same monitoring
purpose. Operational quantities are measurable, and instruments for radiation mon-itoring are calibrated in terms of these quantities. In routine monitoring, the valuesof these operational quantities are taken as a suﬃciently precise assessment of eﬀec-
tive dose and skin dose, respectively, in particular, if their values are below the pro-
tection limits.
(137) No operational quantities have been deﬁned which provide a direct assess-
ment of equivalent or eﬀective dose for internal dosimetry. In general, various mea-surements of incorporated radionuclides are performed and biokinetic models areused in order to estimate the intake of radionuclides. From the intake, equivalentor eﬀective dose is calculated by using reference dose coeﬃcients (doses per unit in-take, Sv Bq
/C01) recommended by the Commission (see Annex B).
4.4. Assessment of radiation exposure
4.4.1. External radiation exposure
(138) The assessment of doses from exposure to radiation from external sources is
usually performed either by individual monitoring using personal dosimeters wornon the body or, for example in cases of prospective assessments, by measuring or
estimating H*(10) and applying appropriate conversion coeﬃcients. The opera-
tional quantities for individual monitoring are H
p(10) and Hp(0.07). If the personal
dosimeter is worn on a position of the body representative of its exposure, at lowdoses and under the assumption of a uniform whole-body exposure, the value ofH
p(10) provides an eﬀective dose value suﬃciently precise for radiological protec-
tion purposes.ICRP Publication 103
714.4.2. Internal radiation exposure
(139) The system of dose assessment for intakes of radionuclides relies on the cal-
culation of the intake of a radionuclide, which can be considered as an operationalquantity for the dose assessment from internal exposure. The intake can be estimated
either from direct measurements (e.g., external monitoring of the whole body or of
speciﬁc organs and tissues) or indirect measurements (e.g., urine or faeces), or mea-surements on environmental samples, and the application of biokinetic models. Theeﬀective dose is then calculated from the intake using dose coeﬃcients recommendedby the Commission for a large number of radionuclides. Dose coeﬃcients are givenfor members of the public of various ages and for adults who are occupationallyexposed.
(140) Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over
time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention
within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many monthsor years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and theaccumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the deﬁni-tion of committed dose quantities. The committed dose from an incorporated radio-nuclide is the total dose expected to be delivered within a speciﬁed time period. Thecommitted equivalent dose ,H
T(s), in a tissue or organ T is deﬁned by:
HTðsÞ¼Zt0þs
t0_HTðtÞdt ð4:7Þ
where sis the integration time following the intake at time t0. The quantity commit-
ted eﬀective dose E (s) is then given by:
EðsÞ¼X
TwTHTðsÞð 4:8Þ
(141) For compliance with dose limits, the Commission continues to recommend
that the committed dose is assigned to the year in which the intake occurred. For
workers, the committed dose is normally evaluated over the 50-year period followingthe intake. The commitment period of 50 years is a rounded value considered by theCommission to be the working-life expectancy of a young person entering the work-force. The committed eﬀective dose from intakes of radionuclides is also used in pro-spective dose estimates for members of the public. In these cases, a commitmentperiod of 50 years is recommended for adults. For infants and children, the doseis evaluated to the age of 70 years.
(142) The eﬀective dose from occupational intakes of radionuclides is assessed on
the basis of the worker’s intake and the reference dose coeﬃcient. The calculations ofdose coeﬃcients for speciﬁed radionuclides (Sv Bq
/C01) use deﬁned biokinetic and
dosimetric models. Models are used to describe the entry of various chemical formsof radionuclides into the body and their distribution and retention after entering theblood. The computational male and female phantoms are also used to compute, for aseries of sources, the fraction of the energy emitted from a source region S that isICRP Publication 103
72absorbed in target region T. These approximations are considered to be adequate for
the main tasks in radiological protection.
(143) Sex-averaged committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcients e(s)1for the intake of
speciﬁed radionuclides are calculated according to the equation:
eðsÞ¼X

where wTis the tissue weighting factor for tissue T, and hM

mitted equivalent dose coeﬃcients for tissue T of the male and female, respectively,for the commitment period s. The summation in Eqn. (4.9) also extends over the
committed equivalent dose coeﬃcients for the remainder tissues in both the maleand the female.
4.4.3. Occupational exposure
(144) In monitoring occupational exposures to external radiation, individual dosi-
meters measure the personal dose equivalent H
P(10). This measured value is taken as
an assessment of the eﬀective dose under the assumption of a uniform whole bodyexposure. For internal exposure, committed eﬀective doses are generally determinedfrom an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements orother quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiationdose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coeﬃcients (see Annex
B).
(145) The doses obtained from the assessment of occupational exposures from
external radiation and from intakes of radionuclides are combined for the assign-ment of the value of total eﬀective dose, E, for demonstrating compliance with dose
limits and constraints using the following formula:
EﬃH
pð10ÞþEð50Þð 4:10Þ
where Hp(10) is the personal dose equivalent from external exposure and E(50), the
committed eﬀective dose from internal exposure, which is assessed by:
Eð50Þ¼X
jej;inhð50Þ/C1Ij;inhþX
jej;ingð50Þ/C1Ij;ing ð4:11Þ
where ej,inh(50) is the committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcient for activity intakes by inha-
lation of a radionuclide j,Ij,inhis the activity intake of a radionuclide jby inhalation,
ej,ing(50) is the committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcient for activity intakes of a radio-
nuclide jby ingestion, and Ij,ingis the activity intake of a radionuclide jby ingestion.
In the calculation of the eﬀective dose from speciﬁc radionuclides, allowance mayneed to be made for the characteristics of the material taken into the body.
1The lower case symbols eandhare used by convention to denote coeﬃcients of the eﬀective dose E
and the equivalent dose H.ICRP Publication 103
73(146) The dose coeﬃcients used in Eqn. (4.11) are those speciﬁed by the Commis-
sion with no departure from the anatomical, physiological, and biokinetic character-istics of the Reference Male and the Reference Female (ICRP, 2002). Account maybe taken of the physical and chemical characteristics of the intake, including theactivity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of the inhaled aerosol and the
chemical form of the particulate matter to which the speciﬁed radionuclide is
attached. The eﬀective dose assigned in the worker’s dose record is that value whichthe Reference Person would experience owing to the radiation ﬁelds and activity in-takes encountered by the worker. The commitment period of 50 years represents theperiod of possible dose accumulation over a working life (this is only relevant forradionuclides with long physical half-lives and long retention in body tissues).
(147) The incorporation of radionuclides through uncontrolled events involving
wounds has implications beyond compliance with work practices and thus these
events are not included in Eqn. (4.11). The signiﬁcance of these events must be eval-
uated and recorded, appropriate medical treatment provided, and further restrictionof the worker’s exposure considered if warranted.
(148) In the rare case of a signiﬁcant contribution to external exposure of weakly-
penetrating radiation, the contribution of the skin dose to the eﬀective dose needs tobe considered in addition to the terms given in Eq. (4.10) for the assessment of eﬀec-tive dose (see Annex B). The radiation dose from radon isotopes, primarily radon-222, and their decay products may also need to be taken into account in the overall
dose assessment (ICRP 1993a).
(149) In certain situations where individual monitoring with personal dosimeters is
not performed, such as exposure of aircrew, an assessment of eﬀective dose may beobtained from values of the quantity ambient dose equivalent, H*(10). Eﬀective dose
in then calculated using appropriate factors derived from data on the radiation ﬁeld,or by calculating eﬀective dose directly from these data.
4.4.4. Public exposure
(150) The basic principles of estimation of eﬀective doses are the same for mem-
bers of the public as for workers. The annual eﬀective dose to members of the publicis the sum of the eﬀective dose obtained within one year from external exposure andthe committed eﬀective dose from radionuclides incorporated within this year. Thedose is not obtained by direct measurement of individual exposures as for occupa-tional exposure but is mainly determined by eﬄuent and environmental measure-ments, habit data, and modelling. The component due to discharges of
radioactive eﬄuents can be estimated by eﬄuent monitoring for existing
installations or prediction of eﬄuents from the installation or source during the de-sign period. Information on concentrations of radionuclides in eﬄuents and theenvironment are used in conjunction with radioecological modelling (pathway anal-ysis of environmental transport, through air, water, soil, sediments, plants, and ani-mals to humans) to assess doses from external radiation exposure and intakes ofradionuclides (see Annex B).ICRP Publication 103
744.4.5. Medical exposure of patients
(151) The relevant quantity for planning the exposure of patients and risk-beneﬁt
assessments is the equivalent dose or the absorbed dose to irradiated tissues. The useof eﬀective dose for assessing the exposure of patients has severe limitations that
must be considered when quantifying medical exposure. Eﬀective dose can be of
value for comparing doses from diﬀerent diagnostic procedures and for comparingthe use of similar technologies and procedures in diﬀerent hospitals and countriesas well as the use of diﬀerent technologies for the same medical examination. How-ever, for planning the exposure of patients and risk-beneﬁt assessments, the equiva-lent dose or the absorbed dose to irradiated tissues is the relevant quantity.
(152) The assessment and interpretation of eﬀective dose from medical exposure of
patients is very problematic when organs and tissues receive only partial exposure or
a very heterogeneous exposure which is the case especially with x-ray diagnostics.
4.4.6. Application of the eﬀective dose
(153) The main and primary uses of eﬀective dose in radiological protection for
both occupational workers and the general public are:
/C15prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation of protection; and
/C15retrospective dose assessment for demonstrating compliance with dose limits, or
for comparing with dose constraints or reference levels.
(154) In this sense, eﬀective dose is used for regulatory purposes worldwide. In
practical radiological protection applications, eﬀective dose is used for managingthe risks of stochastic eﬀects in workers and the public. The calculation of eﬀectivedose or corresponding conversion coeﬃcients for external exposure, as well as dosecoeﬃcients for internal exposure, are based on absorbed dose, weighting factors(w
Rand wT), and reference values for the human body and its organs and tissues.
Eﬀective dose is not based on data from individual persons (see Annex B). In its gen-
eral application, eﬀective dose does not provide an individual-speciﬁc dose but ratherthat for a Reference Person under a given exposure situation.
(155) There may be some circumstances in which parameter values may be chan-
ged from the reference values in the calculation of eﬀective dose. It is, therefore,important to distinguish between those reference parameter values that might bechanged in the calculation of eﬀective dose under particular circumstances of expo-sure and those values that cannot be changed under the deﬁnition of eﬀective dose
(e.g., the weighting factors). Thus, in the assessment of eﬀective dose in occupational
situations of exposure, changes may be made that, for example, relate to the charac-teristics of an external radiation ﬁeld (e.g., direction of exposure) or to the physicaland chemical characteristics of inhaled or ingested radionuclides. In such cases it isnecessary to clearly state the deviation from the reference parameter values.
(156) In retrospective assessments of doses to speciﬁed individuals that may sub-
stantially exceed dose limits, eﬀective dose can provide a ﬁrst approximate measureof the overall detriment. If radiation dose and risk need to be assessed in a moreICRP Publication 103
75accurate way, further speciﬁc estimates of organ or tissue doses are necessary, espe-
cially if organ-speciﬁc risks for the speciﬁed individuals are needed.
(157) Eﬀective dose is intended for use as a protection quantity on the basis of ref-
erence values and therefore is not recommended for epidemiological evaluations, norshould it be used for detailed speciﬁc retrospective investigations of individual expo-
sure and risk. Rather, absorbed dose should be used with the most appropriate
biokinetic biological eﬀectiveness and risk factor data. Organ or tissue doses, noteﬀective doses, are required for assessing the probability of cancer induction in ex-posed individuals.
(158) The use of eﬀective dose is inappropriate for the assessment of tissue reac-
tions. In such situations it is necessary to estimate absorbed dose and to take intoaccount the appropriate RBE as the basis for any assessment of radiation eﬀects(see Annex B).
4.4.7. Collective eﬀective dose
(159) For the purpose of optimisation of radiological protection, predominantly
in the context of occupational exposure, the Commission has introduced collectivedose quantities (ICRP 1977, 1991b). These quantities take account of the exposureof all individuals in a group over a given time period or during a given operationexecuted by this group in designated radiation areas. In practice, the collective
equivalent dose is used only in special circumstances. The Commission therefore
discusses only the collective eﬀective dose quantity in these Recommendations.The collective eﬀective dose, S(ICRP, 1991b) is calculated as the sum of all individ-
ual eﬀective doses over the time period or during the operation being considered.The special name used for the collective eﬀective dose quantity is the ‘man sievert’.In the optimisation process, diﬀerent radiological protection measures and opera-tional scenarios are compared in terms of assessments of expected individual andcollective eﬀective doses.
(160) The collective eﬀective dose, S, is based on the assumption of a linear dose
eﬀect relationship for stochastic eﬀects without a threshold (the LNT model). On thisbasis it is possible to regard eﬀective doses as additive.
(161) Collective eﬀective dose is an instrument for optimisation, for comparing
radiological technologies and protection procedures. Collective eﬀective dose isnot intended as a tool for epidemiological studies, and it is inappropriate to use itin risk projections. This is because the assumptions implicit in the calculation of col-lective eﬀective dose (e.g., when applying the LNT model) conceal large biological
and statistical uncertainties. Speciﬁcally, the computation of cancer deaths based
on collective eﬀective doses involving trivial exposures to large populations is notreasonable and should be avoided. Such computations based on collective eﬀectivedose were never intended, are biologically and statistically very uncertain, presup-pose a number of caveats that tend not to be repeated when estimates are quotedout of context, and are an incorrect use of this protection quantity.
(162) To avoid inappropriate aggregation of, e.g., very low individual doses over
extended time periods and wide geographical regions, limiting conditions need to beICRP Publication 103
76set. The dose range and the time period should be stated. The collective eﬀective dose
due to individual eﬀective dose values between E1and E2is deﬁned as:
SðE1;E2;DTÞ¼ZE2
E1EdN
dE/C18/C19
DTdE ð4:12Þ
where (d N/dE)dEdenotes the number of individuals who are exposed to an eﬀective
dose between EandE+dEwithin the time period DT(see Annex B). When the range
of individual doses spans several orders of magnitude, the distribution should be char-acterised by dividing it into several ranges of individual dose, each covering no morethan two or three orders of magnitude, with the population size, mean individual dose,
and uncertainty being considered separately for each range. When the collective eﬀec-
tive dose is smaller than the reciprocal of the relevant risk detriment, the risk assessmentshould note that the most likely number of excess health eﬀects is zero (NCRP 1995).
4.5. Uncertainties and judgements
(163) In the evaluation of radiation doses, models are necessary to simulate the
geometry of the external exposure, the biokinetics of the intake and retention of
radionuclides in the human body, and the human anatomy. In many cases, these
models and their parameter values have been developed from experimental investi-gations and human studies in order to derive ‘best estimates’ or ‘central estimates’of model parameter values. Similar considerations apply to the choice of tissueand radiation weighting factors. It is recognised that there are appreciable uncertain-ties in the values of some of the parameters and in the formulation or structures ofthe models themselves. Judgement is needed on the best choice of the necessary mod-els and parameter values for dose assessments (see Annex B).
(164) Uncertainty refers to the level of conﬁdence that can be placed in a given
parameter value or prediction of a model. It is an important factor in all extrapola-tion procedures. In this connection the variability of individual parameters and theaccuracy of measurements are also of great importance. The accuracy of measure-ments and judgements will become less with decreasing doses and increasing com-plexity of the system. Variability refers to quantitative diﬀerences betweenindividual members of the population in question. All these aspects are taken intoaccount in model development in the judgements made (see Annex B).
(165) The lack of certainty or precision in radiation dose models varies for the var-
ious parameters and the circumstances in deﬁned situations. Therefore it is not pos-sible to give values for the uncertainties across the range of ICRP models, despite thefact that their assessment is an important part of model development. Uncertaintiesmay need to be assessed, however, for special cases, and approaches to their use havebeen described in a number of publications, e.g., Goossens et al. (1997), CERRIE(2004), ICRP (1994b, 2005d), Bolch et al. (2003), and Farfan et al. (2005). In general,it can be said that uncertainties of assessments of radiation doses from internal expo-
sures, including the biokinetics of radionuclides, are larger than those from external
exposures. The degree of uncertainty diﬀers between various radionuclides.ICRP Publication 103
77(166) The Commission is aware of the uncertainty or lack of precision in radiation
dose models and eﬀorts are undertaken to critically evaluate and to reduce themwherever possible. For regulatory purposes, the dosimetric models and parametervalues that the Commission recommends are reference values. These are ﬁxed byconvention and are therefore not subject to uncertainty. Equally the Commission
considers that the biokinetic and dosimetric models which are needed for the pur-
pose of dose assessment are deﬁned as reference data and, therefore, are also ﬁxedand not applied with an uncertainty. These models and values are re-evaluated peri-odically and may be changed by ICRP on the basis of such evaluations when newscientiﬁc data and information are available.
(167) Regulatory compliance is determined using point estimates of eﬀective dose
that apply to a Reference Person, regarding these point estimates as subject to nouncertainties. In retrospective assessments of doses that may approach or exceed lim-
its, it may be considered appropriate to make speciﬁc individual estimates of dose
and risk, and also to consider uncertainties in these estimates.
(168) Despite changes in dosimetric modelling, as well as diﬀerences in the compu-
tation of eﬀective dose, previous assessments of equivalent dose or eﬀective doseshould be considered adequate. In general, the Commission does not recommendre-computation of existing values with the new models and parameters.

795. THE SYSTEM OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION OF HUMANS
(169) Everybody is exposed to ionising radiation from natural and man-made
sources. It is convenient to think of the processes causing these human exposuresas a network of events and situations . Each part of the network starts from a source.
Radiation or radioactive material then passes through environmental or other path-ways leading to the exposure of individuals. Finally, the exposure of individuals toradiation or radioactive materials leads to doses to these individuals. Protection
can be achieved by taking action at the source, or at points in the exposure pathways,
and occasionally by modifying the location or characteristics of the exposed individ-uals. For convenience, the environmental pathway is usually taken to include thelink between the source of exposure and the doses received by the individuals. Theavailable points of action have a substantial eﬀect on the system of protection.
(170) The assumed proportional relationship between an increment of dose and an
increment of risk of stochastic eﬀects makes it possible to deal separately with diﬀer-ent parts of this network of events and situations leading to exposure, and to select
those parts that are of relevance in a given situation. To make these selections, how-
ever, it is necessary to deﬁne, for each part of the network, the objectives, the organ-isations (and individuals) responsible for protection, the lines of responsibility, andthe feasibility of obtaining the necessary information. This remains a complex pro-cedure, and the Commission suggests two simpliﬁcations in managing radiologicalsituations.
(171) The ﬁrst simpliﬁcation was used in the 1990 Recommendations and recognises
that individuals are subject to several categories of exposure, which can be dealt with
separately (ICRP, 1991b). For example, most workers who are exposed to radiation
sources as part of their work are also exposed to environmental sources as membersof the public, and to medical exposure as patients. The Commission’s policy contin-ues to be that the control of exposures due to work need not be inﬂuenced by theexposures from these other sources. This policy is still generally reﬂected in the pres-ent Recommendations by the separation of the exposure into three categories (seeSection 5.3): occupational exposure, medical exposure of patients, and public expo-sure. The Commission continues to recommend that, for regulatory purposes, no
attempt be made to add the exposures to the same individual from the diﬀerent cat-
egories of exposure.
(172) The second simpliﬁcation is that, in dealing with the network constituting a
variety of exposure pathways, a distinction is drawn between source-related consid-erations and individual-related considerations (see Section 5.5). Although withineach category of exposure individuals can be exposed to several sources, for the pur-poses of radiological protection each source, or group of sources, can be treated onits own (ICRP, 1991b). It is then necessary to consider the exposure of all the indi-
viduals who could be exposed by this source or group of sources. This procedure is
called a ‘source-related assessment’.
(173) For the practical control of exposures, in Publication 60 the network of
events and situations causing these exposures was divided into two broad classes
81of situations: practices and interventions. Practices were deﬁned as human actions
increasing exposure either by introducing whole new blocks of sources, pathways,and individuals, or by modifying the network of pathways from existing sourcesto individuals and thus increasing the exposure of individuals or the number of indi-viduals so exposed. Interventions were deﬁned as human actions that decrease the
overall exposure by inﬂuencing the existing form of the network. These activities
may remove existing sources, modify pathways or reduce the number of exposedindividuals. In the revised system of protection the Recommendations of the Com-mission have now evolved from a process-based approach to an approach basedon the characteristics of three types of radiation exposure situation, i.e., planned,emergency, and existing exposure situations (see Section 5.2).
5.1. The deﬁnition of a source
(174) The Commission uses the term ‘source’ to indicate any physical entity or
procedure that results in a potentially quantiﬁable radiation dose to a person orgroup of persons. It can be a physical source (e.g., radioactive material or anx-ray machine), an installation (e.g., a hospital or a nuclear power plant), or proce-dures or groups of physical sources having similar characteristics (e.g., nuclear med-icine procedures or background or environmental radiation). If radioactivesubstances are released from an installation into the environment, the installation
as a whole may be regarded as a source; if they are already dispersed in the environ-
ment, the portion of them to which people are exposed may be considered a source.Most situations will give rise to a predominant source of exposure for any single indi-vidual, making it possible to treat sources singly when considering actions.
(175) In general, the deﬁnition of a source will be linked to the selection of the rel-
evant protection strategy, as appropriate, for optimisation. Diﬃculties will arise if thepolicy is distorted, e.g., by artiﬁcially subdividing a source in order to avoid the needfor protective action, or by excessively aggregating sources to exaggerate the need for
action. Provided that the regulatory authority and the user (where one can be deﬁned)
both apply the spirit of the Commission’s broad policies, practical agreements can bereached on the deﬁnition of a source.
5.2. Types of exposure situations
(176) The Commission intends its Recommendations to be applied to all sources
and to individuals exposed to radiation in the following three types of exposure sit-
uations which address all conceivable circumstances.
/C15Planned exposure situations are situations involving the deliberate introduction
and operation of sources. Planned exposure situations may give rise both to expo-sures that are anticipated to occur (normal exposures) and to exposures that are
not anticipated to occur (potential exposures; see Section 6.1.3).
/C15Emergency exposure situations are situations that may occur during the operation
of a planned situation, or from a malicious act, or from any other unexpectedICRP Publication 103
82situation, and require urgent action in order to avoid or reduce undesirable
consequences.
/C15Existing exposure situations are exposure situations that already exist when a deci-
sion on control has to be taken, including prolonged exposure situations afteremergencies.
It follows that what the Commission has called ‘practices’ could be the origin of
planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations. Medical exposures of patientsare also planned exposure situations, but because of the characteristics of such expo-sures, they are discussed separately. The principles of protection for planned situa-
tions also apply to occupational exposure in connection with existing and
emergency exposure situations.
5.3. Categories of exposure
(177) The Commission distinguishes between three categories of exposures: occu-
pational exposures, public exposures, and medical exposures of patients. Exposuresof comforters and carers, and exposures of volunteers in research, are discussed in
Chapter 7.
5.3.1. Occupational exposure
(178) Occupational exposure is deﬁned by the Commission as all radiation expo-
sure of workers incurred as a result of their work. The Commission has noted theconventional deﬁnition of occupational exposure to any hazardous agent as includ-ing all exposures at work, regardless of their source. However, because of the ubiq-
uity of radiation, the direct application of this deﬁnition to radiation would mean
that all workers should be subject to a regime of radiological protection. The Com-mission therefore limits its use of ‘occupational exposures’ to radiation exposures in-curred at work as a result of situations that can reasonably be regarded as being theresponsibility of the operating management (see also Section 6.3.1). Excluded expo-sures and exposures from exempt practices or exempt sources generally do not needto be accounted for in occupational protection.
(179) The employer has the main responsibility for the protection of workers.
However, the licensee responsible for the source (if not identical to the employer)
also has a responsibility for the radiological protection of workers. If workers areengaged in work that involves, or could involve, a source that is not under the con-trol of their employer, the licensee and the employer should co-operate by the ex-change of information and otherwise as necessary to facilitate proper radiologicalprotection at the workplace.
5.3.2. Public exposure
(180) Public exposure encompasses all exposures of the public other than occupa-
tional exposures and medical exposures of patients (see Section 5.3.3). It is incurredICRP Publication 103
83as a result of a range of radiation sources. The component of public exposure due to
natural sources is by far the largest, but this provides no justiﬁcation for reducing theattention paid to smaller, but more readily controllable, exposures to man-madesources. Exposures of the embryo and fetus of pregnant workers are consideredand regulated as public exposures.
5.3.3. Medical exposure of patients
(181) Radiation exposures of patients occur in diagnostic, interventional, and
therapeutic procedures. There are several features of radiological practices in medi-cine that require an approach that diﬀers from the radiological protection in otherplanned exposure situations. The exposure is intentional and for the direct beneﬁtof the patient. Particularly in radiotherapy, the biological eﬀects of high-dose radi-
ation, e.g., cell killing, are used for the beneﬁt of the patient to treat cancer and other
diseases. The application of these Recommendations to the medical uses of radiationtherefore requires separate guidance (see Chapter 7, which also discusses the medicalexposure of comforters and carers and of volunteers in research).
5.4. The identiﬁcation of the exposed individuals
(182) It is necessary to deal separately with at least three categories of exposed
individuals, namely workers, the public, and patients. They essentially correspond
to individuals whose exposures fall into the three categories of exposure deﬁned inSection 5.3. A given individual may be exposed as a worker, and/or as a memberof the public, and/or as a patient.
5.4.1. Workers
(183) A worker is deﬁned by the Commission as any person who is employed,
whether full time, part time, or temporarily, by an employer and who has recognised
rights and duties in relation to occupational radiological protection. A self-employedperson is regarded as having the duties of both an employer and a worker. Workersin medical professions involving radiation are occupationally exposed.
(184) One important function of an employer and/or licensee is that of maintaining
control over the sources of exposure and over the protection of workers who areoccupationally exposed. In order to achieve this, the Commission continues to rec-ommend the classiﬁcation of areas of work rather than the classiﬁcation of workers.
Requiring that the areas of workplaces containing sources be formally designated
helps their control. The Commission uses two such designations: controlled areas
andsupervised areas . A controlled area is a deﬁned area in which speciﬁc protection
measures and safety provisions are, or could be, required for controlling normalexposures or preventing the spread of contamination during normal working condi-tions, and preventing or limiting the extent of potential exposures. A supervised areais one in which the working conditions are kept under review but special proceduresICRP Publication 103
84are not normally needed. A controlled area is often within a supervised area, but need
not be.
(185) Workers in ‘controlled areas’ of workplaces should be well informed and
specially trained, and form a readily identiﬁable group. Such workers are most oftenmonitored for radiation exposures incurred in the workplace, and occasionally may
receive special medical surveillance.
The exposure of pregnant or breast-feeding workers
(186) In the 1990 Recommendations, the Commission concluded that, for the pur-
pose of controlling occupational exposure, there was no reason to distinguish be-tween the two sexes. The Commission maintains this policy with theseRecommendations. However, if a female worker has declared (i.e., notiﬁed her em-ployer) that she is pregnant, additional controls have to be considered to protect the
embryo/fetus. It is the Commission’s policy that the methods of protection at work
for women who are pregnant should provide a level of protection for the embryo/fe-tus broadly similar to that provided for members of the public. The Commissionconsiders that this policy will be adequately applied if the mother is exposed, priorto her declaration of pregnancy, under the system of protection recommended bythe Commission. Once an employer has been notiﬁed of a pregnancy, additional pro-tection of the embryo/fetus should be considered. The working conditions of a preg-nant worker, after declaration of pregnancy, should be such as to ensure that the
additional dose to the embryo/fetus would not exceed about 1 mSv during the
remainder of the pregnancy. Additional guidance on protection of an embryo/fetusexposed to radiation is provided in Section 7.4.
(187) The restriction of the dose to the embryo/fetus does not mean that it is nec-
essary for pregnant women to avoid work with radiation or radioactive materialscompletely, or that they must be prevented from entering or working in designatedradiation areas (see paragraph 184). It does, however, imply that the employershould carefully review the exposure conditions of pregnant women. In particular,
if required, their working conditions should be changed such that, during pregnancy,
the probability of accidental doses and radionuclide intakes is extremely low. Speciﬁcrecommendations on the control of exposures to pregnant workers are given in Pub-
lications 84 and88(ICRP, 2000a, 2001a). The Commission has also published infor-
mation in Publication 95 (ICRP, 2004c) that enables doses to oﬀspring following
intakes to breast-feeding mothers to be calculated. The Commission strongly recom-mends that in order to protect the embryo/fetus or infant, females who have declaredthat they are pregnant or are nursing should not be involved in emergency actions
involving high radiation doses (ICRP, 2005a).
(188) In Publication 88 (ICRP, 2001a), the Commission gave dose coeﬃcients for
the embryo, fetus, and newborn child from intakes of radionuclides by the mother be-fore or during pregnancy. In general, doses to the embryo, fetus, and newborn childare similar to or less than those to the Reference Female. In Publication 95 (ICRP,
2004c) the Commission provided information on radiation doses to the breast-feedinginfant due to intakes of radionuclides in maternal milk. For most of the radionuclidesICRP Publication 103
85considered, doses to the infant from radionuclides ingested in breast milk are esti-
mated to be small in comparison with doses to the Reference Female.
Exposures in aviation and in space
(189) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), the Commission recommended that expo-
sures to cosmic radiation be part of occupational exposure in the operation of com-
mercial jet aircraft and space ﬂight. The Commission subsequently clariﬁed itsrecommendation in Publication 75 (ICRP, 1997a), indicating that it is not necessary
to treat the exposure of frequent-ﬂyer passengers as occupationally exposed for thepurpose of control. Thus, essentially, only aircrew should be considered. At thattime, the Commission had already noted that the only practical regulatory measureswere controlling individual exposure through the control of ﬂying time and routeselection. The Commission maintains this view.
(190) Exceptional cases of cosmic radiation exposures, such as exposure in space
travel, where doses may be signiﬁcant and some type of control warranted, should bedealt with separately, taking into account the special type of situations that can giverise to this type of exposure.
5.4.2. Members of the public
(191) A member of the public is deﬁned by the Commission as any individual who
receives an exposure that is neither occupational nor medical (see also Section 5.4.3).
A large range of diﬀerent natural and man-made sources contribute to the exposureof members of the public.
(192) In general, especially for public exposure, each source will result in a distri-
bution of doses over many individuals. For the purposes of protection of the public,the Commission has used the ‘critical group’ concept to characterise an individualreceiving a dose that is representative of the more highly exposed individuals inthe population (ICRP, 1977). Dose restrictions have been applied to the mean dose
in the appropriate critical group. Over the past decades, a considerable body of expe-
rience has been gained in the application of the critical group concept. There havealso been developments in the techniques used to assess doses to members of thepublic, notably the increasing use of probabilistic techniques. The adjective ‘critical’has the connotation of a crisis, which was never intended by the Commission. Fur-thermore, the word ‘group’ may be confusing in the context where the assessed doseis to an individual.
(193) The Commission now recommends the use of the ‘Representative Person’ for
the purpose of radiological protection of the public instead of the earlier critical group
concept. The Commission provides guidance on characterising the Representative Per-son and assessing doses to the Representative Person in Publication 101 (ICRP, 2006a).
(194) The Representative Person may be hypothetical, but it is important that the
habits (e.g., consumption of foodstuﬀs, breathing rate, location, usage of local re-sources) used to characterise the Representative Person are typical habits of a smallnumber of individuals representative of those most highly exposed and not theextreme habits of a single member of the population. Consideration may be givenICRP Publication 103
86to some extreme or unusual habits, but they should not dictate the characteristics of
the Representative Persons considered.
5.4.3. Patients
(195) The Commission deﬁnes the patient as an individual who receives an expo-
sure associated with a diagnostic, interventional, or therapeutic procedure. TheCommission’s dose limits and dose constraints are not recommended for individualpatients because they may reduce the eﬀectiveness of the patient’s diagnosis or treat-ment, thereby doing more harm than good. The emphasis is therefore on the justiﬁ-cation of the medical procedures and on the optimisation of protection and, fordiagnostic procedures, the use of diagnostic reference levels (see Chapter 7).
(196) The exposure of patients who are pregnant is dealt with in Section 7.4.
5.5. Levels of radiological protection
(197) In the 1990 Recommendations it was noted that, provided that individual
doses are well below the thresholds for harmful deterministic eﬀects, the eﬀect of acontribution to an individual dose from a source is independent of the eﬀects ofdoses from other sources. For many purposes, each source or group of sources couldusually be treated on its own. It is then necessary to consider the exposure of indi-
viduals exposed by this source or group of sources. This procedure is called a
‘source-related’ approach. The Commission now emphasises the primary importanceof the source-related approach, because action can be taken on a source to assure theprotection of a group of individuals from that source.
(198) For planned exposure situations, the source-related restriction to the dose that
individuals may incur is the dose constraint . For potential exposures, the correspond-
ing concept is the risk constraint. For emergency and existing exposure situations, the
source-related restriction is the reference level (see Sections 5.9, 6.2, and 6.3). The con-
cepts of a dose constraint and reference level are used in the process of optimisation of
protection to assist in ensuring that all exposures are kept as low as reasonably achiev-able, societal and economic factors being taken into account. Constraints and refer-ence levels can thus be described as key parts in the optimisation process that willensure appropriate levels of protection under the prevailing circumstances.
(199) It could be argued that the source-related restriction would not provide suﬃ-
cient protection where there are multiple sources. However, the Commission presumesthat there will generally be a dominant source, and the selection of the appropriate ref-
erence level or constraint ensures an adequate level of protection. The Commission still
considers that the source-related principle of optimisation below the constraint or ref-erence level is the most eﬀective tool for protection, whatever the situation.
(200) In the speciﬁc case of planned exposure situations, separate restrictions on the
sums of the occupational doses and on the sums of the public doses are required. TheCommission refers to such individual-related restrictions as dose limits (see Section5.10) and the corresponding assessment of doses is called ‘individual-related’.ICRP Publication 103
87(201) It is rarely possible, however, to assess the total exposure of an individual
from all such sources. It is therefore necessary to make approximations to the doseto be compared with the quantitative limit, especially in the case of public exposure.For occupational exposures, the approximations are more likely to be accurate be-
cause the operating management has access to the necessary information to identify
and control the dose from all the relevant sources.
(202) Figure 3 illustrates the diﬀerences in concept between the use of individual
dose limits in planned situations and constraints or reference levels for protectionfrom a source in all situations.
5.6. The principles of radiological protection
(203) In the 1990 Recommendations, the Commission gave principles of protec-
tion for practices separately from intervention situations. The Commission continuesto regard these principles as fundamental for the system of protection, and has nowformulated a single set of principles that apply to planned, emergency, and existingexposure situations. In these Recommendations, the Commission also clariﬁes howthe fundamental principles apply to radiation sources and to the individual, as wellas how the source-related principles apply to all controllable situations.
Two principles are source-related and apply in all exposure situations
/C15The principle of justiﬁcation: Any decision that alters the radiation exposure situ-
ation should do more good than harm.
This means that, by introducing a new radiation source, by reducing existing expo-
sure, or by reducing the risk of potential exposure, one should achieve suﬃcient indi-vidual or societal beneﬁt to oﬀset the detriment it causes.
Fig. 3. Dose limits contrasted with dose constraints and reference levels for protecting workers and
members of the public.ICRP Publication 103
88/C15The principle of optimisation of protection: the likelihood of incurring exposures,
the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses shouldall be kept as low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic andsocietal factors.
This means that the level of protection should be the best under the prevailing cir-
cumstances, maximising the margin of beneﬁt over harm. In order to avoid severelyinequitable outcomes of this optimisation procedure, there should be restrictions onthe doses or risks to individuals from a particular source (dose or risk constraintsand reference levels).
One principle is individual-related and applies in planned exposure situations
/C15The principle of application of dose limits: The total dose to any individual from
regulated sources in planned exposure situations other than medical exposure
of patients should not exceed the appropriate limits recommended by the
Commission.
(204) Regulatory dose limits are determined by the regulatory authority, taking
account of international recommendations, and apply to workers and to members
of the public in planned exposure situations.
5.7. Justiﬁcation
(205) The Commission recommends that, when activities involving an increased or
decreased level of radiation exposure, or a risk of potential exposure, are being con-sidered, the expected change in radiation detriment should be explicitly included inthe decision-making process. The consequences to be considered are not conﬁned to
those associated with the radiation – they include other risks and the costs and ben-
eﬁts of the activity. Sometimes, the radiation detriment will be a small part of thetotal. Justiﬁcation thus goes far beyond the scope of radiological protection. It isfor these reasons that the Commission only recommends that justiﬁcation requirethat the net beneﬁt be positive. To search for the best of all the available alternativesis a task beyond the responsibility of radiological protection authorities.
5.7.1. Application of the principle of justiﬁcation
(206) There are two diﬀerent approaches to applying the principle of justiﬁcation
in situations involving occupational and public exposure, which depend uponwhether or not the source can be directly controlled. The ﬁrst approach is used inthe introduction of new activities where radiological protection is planned in ad-vance and the necessary actions can be taken on the source. Application of the jus-tiﬁcation principle to these situations requires that no planned exposure situationshould be introduced unless it produces suﬃcient net beneﬁt to the exposed individ-
uals or to society to oﬀset the radiation detriment it causes. Judgements on whether it
would be justiﬁable to introduce or continue particular types of planned situationICRP Publication 103
89involving exposure to ionising radiation are important. The justiﬁcation may need to
be re-examined as new information or technology becomes available.
(207) The second approach is used where exposures can be controlled mainly by
action to modify the pathways of exposure and not by acting directly on the source.The main examples are existing exposure situations and emergency exposure situa-
tions. In these circumstances, the principle of justiﬁcation is applied in making the
decision as to whether to take action to avert further exposure. Any decision takento reduce doses, which always have some disadvantages, should be justiﬁed in thesense that they should do more good than harm.
(208) In both approaches, the responsibility for judging the justiﬁcation usually
falls on governments or national authorities to ensure an overall beneﬁt in the broad-est sense to society and thus not necessarily to each individual. However, input to thejustiﬁcation decision may include many aspects that could be informed by users or
other organisations or persons outside of government. As such, justiﬁcation deci-
sions will often be informed by a process of public consultation, depending upon,among other things, the size of the source concerned. There are many aspects of jus-tiﬁcation, and diﬀerent organisations may be involved and responsible. In this con-text, radiological protection considerations will serve as one input to the broaderdecision process.
(209) Medical exposure of patients calls for a diﬀerent and more detailed approach
to the process of justiﬁcation. The medical use of radiation should be justiﬁed, as is
any other planned exposure situation, although that justiﬁcation lies more often with
the profession than with government or the competent regulatory authority. Theprincipal aim of medical exposures is to do more good than harm to the patient,due account being taken of the radiation detriment from the exposure of the radio-logical staﬀ and of other individuals. The responsibility for the justiﬁcation of the useof a particular procedure falls on the relevant medical practitioners, who need tohave special training in radiological protection. Justiﬁcation of medical procedurestherefore remains part of the Commission’s Recommendations (see Section 7.1).
5.7.2. Unjustiﬁed exposures
(210) The Commission considers that certain exposures should be deemed to be
unjustiﬁed without further analysis, unless there are exceptional circumstances.These include the following:
/C15Increasing, by deliberate addition of radioactive substances or by activation, the
activity of products such as food, beverages, cosmetics, toys, and personal jewel-lery or adornments.
/C15Radiological examination for occupational, health insurance, or legal purposes
undertaken without reference to clinical indications, unless the examination isexpected to provide useful information on the health of the individual examined
or in support of important criminal investigations. This almost always means that
a clinical evaluation of the image acquired must be carried out, otherwise theexposure is not justiﬁed.ICRP Publication 103
90/C15Medical screening of asymptomatic population groups involving radiation expo-
sure, unless the expected advantages for the individuals examined or for the pop-ulation as a whole are suﬃcient to compensate for the economic and societalcosts, including the radiation detriment. Account should be taken of the potentialof the screening procedure for detecting disease, the likelihood of eﬀective treat-
ment of cases detected, and, for certain diseases, the advantages to the community
of control of the disease.
5.8. Optimisation of protection
(211) The process of optimisation of protection is intended for application to those
situations that have been deemed to be justiﬁed. The principle of optimisation ofprotection, with restriction on the magnitude of individual dose or risk, is centralto the system of protection and applies to all three exposure situations: plannedexposure situations, emergency exposure situations, and existing exposure situations.
(212) The principle of optimisation is deﬁned by the Commission as the source-
related process to keep the likelihood of incurring exposures (where these are not cer-
tain to be received), the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of individualdoses as low as reasonably achievable, taking economic and societal factors intoaccount.
(213) The Recommendations of the Commission on how to apply the optimisation
principle have been provided earlier (ICRP, 1983, 1989, 1991b, and 2006a), and theseRecommendations remain valid and will not be repeated in detail here. The decision-aiding techniques are still essential to ﬁnd the optimised radiological protection
solution in an objective manner; these techniques include methods for quantitative
optimisation such as cost-beneﬁt analyses. The process of optimisation over the pastdecades has resulted in substantial reductions of occupational and public exposures.
(214) Optimisation is always aimed at achieving the best level of protection under
the prevailing circumstances through an ongoing, iterative process that involves:
/C15evaluation of the exposure situation, including any potential exposures (the fram-
ing of the process);
/C15selection of an appropriate value for the constraint or reference level;
/C15identiﬁcation of the possible protection options;
/C15selection of the best option under the prevailing circumstances; and
/C15implementation of the selected option.
(215) Experience has shown how optimisation of protection has improved radio-
logical protection for planned situations. Constraints provide a desired upper boundfor the optimisation process. Some sources and technologies are able to satisfy con-straints that are set at a low level, while others are only able to meet constraints set at
a higher level. This is normal and should be reﬂected in the freedom of regulatory
authorities and others, as appropriate, to select values that are appropriate for par-ticular circumstances.
(216) In all situations, the process of optimisation with the use of constraints or
reference levels is applied in planning protective actions and in establishing theICRP Publication 103
91appropriate level of protection under the prevailing circumstances. The doses to be
compared with the dose constraint or reference levels are usually prospective doses,i.e., doses that may be received in the future, as it is only those doses that can beinﬂuenced by decisions on protective actions. They are not intended as a form of ret-rospective dose limit.
(217) The optimisation of protection is a forward-looking iterative process aimed
at preventing or reducing future exposures. It takes into account both technical andsocio-economic developments and requires both qualitative and quantitative judge-ments. The process should be systematic and carefully structured to ensure that allrelevant aspects are taken into account. Optimisation is a frame of mind, alwaysquestioning whether the best has been done in the prevailing circumstances, andwhether all that is reasonable has been done to reduce doses. It also requires com-mitment at all levels in all concerned organisations as well as adequate procedures
and resources.
(218) The best option is always speciﬁc to the exposure situation and represents the
best level of protection that can be achieved under the prevailing circumstances. There-fore it is not relevant to determine, a priori, a dose level below which the optimisationprocess should stop. Depending on the exposure situation, the best option could beclose to or well below the appropriate source-related constraint or reference level.
(219) Optimisation of protection is not minimisation of dose. Optimised protec-
tion is the result of an evaluation, which carefully balances the detriment from the
exposure and the resources available for the protection of individuals. Thus the best
option is not necessarily the one with the lowest dose.
(220) In addition to the reduction of the magnitude of individual exposures, a
reduction of the number of exposed individuals should also be considered. The col-lective eﬀective dose has been and remains a key parameter for optimisation of pro-tection for workers. The comparison of protection options for the purpose ofoptimisation must entail a careful consideration of the characteristics of the individ-ual exposure distribution within an exposed population.
(221) When exposures occur over large populations, large geographical areas, or
long time periods, the total collective eﬀective dose is not a useful tool for makingdecisions because it may aggregate information inappropriately and could be mis-leading for selecting protective actions. To overcome the limitations associated withcollective eﬀective dose, each relevant exposure situation must be carefully analysedto identify the individual characteristics and exposure parameters that best describethe exposure distribution among the concerned population for the particular circum-stance. Such an analysis – by asking when, where and by whom exposures are
received – results in the identiﬁcation of various population groups with homoge-
neous characteristics for which collective eﬀective doses can be calculated withinthe optimisation process, and for which an optimised protection strategy can be de-ﬁned (see Section 4.4). In practical optimisation assessments, collective doses may of-ten be truncated, because the assessments use the diﬀerence between the integralsdeﬁning the collective doses assigned to the various alternative protective options un-der consideration, rather than the full integrals (ICRP, 1983).ICRP Publication 103
92(222) In Publications 77 and81(ICRP, 1997d, 1998b), the Commission recognised
that both the individual doses and the size of the exposed population becomeincreasingly uncertain as time increases. The Commission is of the opinion that inthe decision-making process, owing to the increasing uncertainties, giving less weightto very low doses and to doses received in the distant future could be considered (see
also Section 4.4.7). The Commission does not intend to give detailed guidance on
such weighting, but rather stresses the importance of demonstrating in a transparentmanner how any weighting has been carried out.
(223) All aspects of optimisation cannot be codiﬁed; rather, there should be a com-
mitment by all parties to the optimisation process. Where optimisation becomes amatter for the regulatory authority, the focus should not be on speciﬁc outcomesfor a particular situation, but rather on processes, procedures, and judgements.An open dialogue should be established between the authority and the operating
management, and the success of the optimisation process will depend strongly on
the quality of this dialogue.
(224) Societal values usually inﬂuence the ﬁnal decision on the level of radiological
protection. Therefore, while this report should be seen as providing decision-aidingrecommendations mainly based on scientiﬁc considerations on radiological protec-tion, the Commission’s advice will be expected to serve as an input to a ﬁnal (usuallywider) decision-making process, which may include other societal concerns and eth-ical aspects, as well as considerations of transparency (ICRP, 2006a). This decision-
making process may often include the participation of relevant stakeholders rather
than radiological protection specialists alone.
5.9. Dose constraints and reference levels
(225) The concepts of dose constraint and reference level are used in conjunction
with the optimisation of protection to restrict individual doses. A level of individualdose, either as a dose constraint or a reference level, always needs to be deﬁned. The
initial intention would be to not exceed, or to remain at, these levels, and the ambi-
tion is to reduce all doses to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable, economicand societal factors being taken into account.
(226) For the sake of continuity with its earlier Recommendations (ICRP,
1991b), the Commission retains the term ‘dose constraint’ for this level of dosein planned exposure situations (with the exception of medical exposure of patients).For emergency exposure situations and existing exposure situations, the Commis-sion proposes the term ‘reference level’ to describe this level of dose. The diﬀerence
in terminology between planned and other exposure situations (emergency and
existing) has been retained by the Commission to express the fact that, in plannedsituations, the restriction on individual doses can be applied at the planning stage,and the doses can be forecast so as to ensure that the constraint will not beexceeded. With the other situations a wider range of exposures may exist, andthe optimisation process may apply to initial levels of individual doses above thereference level.ICRP Publication 103
93(227) Diagnostic reference levels are already being used in medical diagnosis (i.e.,
planned exposure situations) to indicate whether, in routine conditions, the levels ofpatient dose or administered activity from a speciﬁed imaging procedure areunusually high or low for that procedure. If so, a local review should be initiatedto determine whether protection has been adequately optimised or whether correc-tive action is required.
(228) The chosen value for a constraint or a reference level will depend upon the cir-
cumstances of the exposure under consideration. It must also be realised that neither
dose and risk constraints nor reference levels represent a demarcation between ‘safe’
and ‘dangerous’ or reﬂect a step change in the associated health risk for individuals.
(229) In Table 4 the diﬀerent types of dose restrictions used in the Commission’s
system of protection (limits, constraints, reference levels) are shown in relation totype of exposure situation and category of exposure. In planned exposure situations,there are also risk constraints in order to take account of potential exposures.
5.9.1. Dose constraints
(230) A dose constraint is a prospective and source-related restriction on the indi-
vidual dose from a source in planned exposure situations (except in medical exposureof patients), which serves as an upper bound on the predicted dose in the optimisa-tion of protection for that source. It is a level of dose above which it is unlikely thatprotection is optimised for a given source of exposure, and for which, therefore, ac-tion must almost always be taken. Dose constraints for planned situations representa basic level of protection and will always be lower than the pertinent dose limit.
During planning it must be ensured that the source concerned does not imply doses
exceeding the constraint. Optimisation of protection will establish an acceptable levelof dose below the constraint. This optimised level then becomes the expected out-come of the planned protective actions.Table 4. The dose constraints and reference levels used in the Commission’s system of
protection.

94(231) The action necessary if a dose constraint is exceeded includes determining
whether protection has been optimised, whether the appropriate dose constrainthas been selected, and whether further steps to reduce doses to acceptable levelswould be appropriate. For potential exposures, the corresponding source-relatedrestriction is called a risk constraint (see Section 6.1.3). Treating a dose constraint
as a target value is not suﬃcient, and optimisation of protection will be necessary
to establish an acceptable level of dose below the constraint.
(232) The concept of dose constraints was introduced in Publication 60 as a means
of ensuring that the optimisation process did not create inequity, i.e., the possibilitythat some individuals in an optimised protection scheme may be subject to muchmore exposure than the average:
‘Most of the methods used in the optimisation of protection tend to emphasise the
beneﬁts and detriments to society and the whole exposed population. The beneﬁtsand detriments are unlikely to be distributed through society in the same way.Optimisation of protection may thus introduce a substantial inequity betweenone individual and another. This inequity can be limited by incorporatingsource-related restrictions on individual dose into the process of optimization.The Commission calls these source-related restrictions dose constraints, previ-ously called upper bounds. They form an integral part of the optimization of pro-
tection. For potential exposures, the corresponding concept is the risk constraint .’
(ICRP, 1991b)
This statement continues to represent the Commission’s view.
(233) For occupational exposures, the dose constraint is a value of individual dose
used to limit the range of options such that only options expected to cause dosesbelow the constraint are considered in the process of optimisation. For public expo-
sure, the dose constraint is an upper bound on the annual doses that members of the
public could receive from the planned operation of a speciﬁed controlled source. TheCommission wishes to emphasise that dose constraints are not to be used or under-stood as prescriptive regulatory limits.
5.9.2. Reference levels
(234) In emergency or existing controllable exposure situations, the reference levels
represent the level of dose or risk, above which it is judged to be inappropriate to
plan to allow exposures to occur (cf. Section 6.2), and for which therefore protectiveactions should be planned and optimised. The chosen value for a reference level willdepend upon the prevailing circumstances of the exposure situation underconsideration.
(235) When an emergency exposure situation has occurred, or an existing exposure
situation has been identiﬁed, and protective actions have been implemented, doses toworkers and members of the public can be measured or assessed. The reference level
may then assume a diﬀerent function as a benchmark against which protection op-
tions can be judged retrospectively. The distribution of doses that has resulted fromICRP Publication 103
95the implementation of a planned protective strategy may or may not include
exposures above the reference level, depending on the success of the strategy. Eﬀortsshould, however, be aimed at reducing any exposures that are above the referencelevel to a level that is below, if possible.
5.9.3. Factors inﬂuencing the choice of source-related dose constraints and reference
levels
(236) At doses higher than 100 mSv, there is an increased likelihood of determin-
istic eﬀects and a signiﬁcant risk of cancer. For these reasons, the Commission con-siders that the maximum value for a reference level is 100 mSv incurred either acutelyor in a year. Exposures above 100 mSv incurred either acutely or in a year would bejustiﬁed only under extreme circumstances, either because the exposure is unavoid-
able or in exceptional situations such as the saving of life or the prevention of a seri-
ous disaster. No other individual or societal beneﬁt would compensate for such highexposures (see ICRP, 2005a).
(237) Many of the numerical criteria recommended by the Commission in Publi-
cation 60 and subsequent publications can be, with the exception of the limits, re-
garded as constraints or reference levels. The values fall into three deﬁned bands(see Table 5) with the attributes described in the following paragraphs. The Commis-sion considers that it is useful to present these values in this manner as it enables
selection of an appropriate value for a constraint or a reference level for a speciﬁc
situation that has not been addressed explicitly by the Commission.
(238) The Commission’s banding of constraints and reference levels (see Table
5) applies across all three exposure situations and refers to the projected dose overa time period that is appropriate for the situation under consideration. Constraintsfor planned exposures and reference levels in existing situations are conventionallyexpressed as an annual eﬀective dose (mSv in a year). In emergency situations thereference level will be expressed as the total residual dose to an individual as a
result of the emergency that the regulator would plan not to exceed, either acute
(and not expected to be repeated) or, in case of protracted exposure, on an annualbasis.
(239) The ﬁrst band, 1 mSv or less, applies to exposure situations where individ-
uals receive exposures – usually planned – that may be of no direct beneﬁt to thembut the exposure situation may be of beneﬁt to society. The exposure of members ofthe public from the planned operation of practices is a prime example of this type ofsituation. Constraints and reference levels in this band would be selected for situa-
tions where there is general information and environmental surveillance or monitor-
ing or assessment and where individuals may receive information but no training.The corresponding doses would represent a marginal increase above the naturalbackground and are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the maximum valuefor a reference level, thus providing a rigorous level of protection.
(240) The second band, greater than 1 mSv but not more than 20 mSv, applies in
circumstances where individuals receive direct beneﬁts from an exposure situation.Constraints and reference levels in this band will often be set in circumstances whereICRP Publication 103
96there is individual surveillance or dose monitoring or assessment, and where individ-
uals beneﬁt from training or information. The constraints set for occupationalexposure in planned exposure situations are examples. Exposure situations involvingTable 5. Framework for source-related dose constraints and reference levels with examples of constraints for

cSituations in which the dose threshold for deterministic eﬀects in relevant organs or tissues could be
exceeded should always require action.ICRP Publication 103
97abnormally high levels of natural background radiation, or stages in post-accident
rehabilitation may also be in this band.
(241) The third band, greater than 20 mSv but not more than 100 mSv, applies in
unusual, and often extreme, situations where actions taken to reduce exposureswould be disruptive. Reference levels and, occasionally for ‘one-oﬀ’ exposures below
50 mSv, constraints could also be set in this range in circumstances where beneﬁts
from the exposure situation are commensurately high. Action taken to reduce expo-sures in a radiological emergency is the main example of this type of situation. TheCommission considers that a dose rising towards 100 mSv will almost always justifyprotective action. In addition, situations in which the dose threshold for determin-istic eﬀects in relevant organs or tissues could be exceeded should always requireaction (see also paragraph 83 in ICRP, 1999a).
(242) A necessary stage in applying the principle of optimisation of protection is
the selection of an appropriate value for the dose constraint or the reference level.
The ﬁrst step is to characterise the relevant exposure situation in terms of the natureof the exposure, the beneﬁts from the exposure situation to individuals and society,as well as other societal criteria, and the practicability of reducing or preventing theexposures. Comparison of these attributes with the characteristics described in Table5 should enable the selection of the appropriate band for the constraint or the refer-ence level. The speciﬁc value for the constraint or reference level may then be estab-lished by a process of generic optimisation that takes account of national or regional
attributes and preferences together, where appropriate, with a consideration of inter-
national guidance and good practice elsewhere.
5.10. Dose limits
(243) Dose limits apply only in planned exposure situations but not to medical
exposures of patients. The Commission has concluded that the existing dose lim-its that it recommended in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) continue to provide an
appropriate level of protection. The nominal detriment coeﬃcients for both a
workforce and the general public are consistent with, although numerically some-what lower than, those given in 1990. These slight diﬀerences are of nopractical signiﬁcance (see Annex A). Within a category of exposure, occupationalor public, dose limits apply to the sum of exposures from sources related to prac-tices that are already justiﬁed. The recommended dose limits are summarised inTable 6.
(244) For occupational exposure in planned exposure situations, the Commission
continues to recommend that the limit should be expressed as an eﬀective dose of
20 mSv per year, averaged over deﬁned 5 year periods (100 mSv in 5 years), withthe further provision that the eﬀective dose should not exceed 50 mSv in any singleyear.
(245) For public exposure in planned exposure situations, the Commission contin-
ues to recommend that the limit should be expressed as an eﬀective dose of 1 mSv ina year. However, in special circumstances a higher value of eﬀective dose could beICRP Publication 103
98allowed in a single year, provided that the average over deﬁned 5-year periods does
not exceed 1 mSv per year.
(246) The limits on eﬀective dose apply to the sum of doses due to external expo-
sures and committed doses from internal exposures due to intakes of radionuclides.InPublication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), the Commission stated that occupational intakes
may be averaged over a period of 5 years to provide some ﬂexibility. The Commis-sion maintains this view. Similarly, averaging of public intakes over a period of 5years would be acceptable in such special circumstances where averaging of the dose
to members of the public could be allowed (see the previous paragraph).
(247) Dose limits do not apply in emergency exposure situations where an in-
formed, exposed individual is engaged in volunteered life-saving actions or isattempting to prevent a catastrophic situation. For informed volunteers undertakingurgent rescue operations, the normal dose restriction may be relaxed. However,responders undertaking recovery and restoration operations in a later phase of emer-gency exposure situations should be considered as occupationally exposed workersand should be protected according to normal occupational radiological protection
standards, and their exposures should not exceed the occupational dose limits rec-
ommended by the Commission. Since the Commission recommends speciﬁc protec-tion measures for female workers who have declared that they are pregnant or arenursing an infant (see Section 5.4.1), and taking account of the unavoidable uncer-tainties surrounding early response measures in the event of an emergency exposuresituation, female workers in those conditions should not be employed as ﬁrstresponders undertaking life-saving or other urgent actions.Table 6.

cThe limitation on eﬀective dose provides suﬃcient protection for the skinagainst stochastic eﬀects.
dAveraged over 1 cm2area of skin regardless of the area exposed.
eWith the further provision that the eﬀective dose should not exceed 50 mSvin any single year. Additional restrictions apply to the occupational expo-sure of pregnant women.
fIn special circumstances, a higher value of eﬀective dose could be allowed in
a single year, provided that the average over 5 years does not exceed 1 mSv
per year.ICRP Publication 103
99(248) For informed individuals of the general public involved in caring and com-
forting patients released from a hospital following therapy with unsealed radionuc-lides, the normal dose restriction may be relaxed and such individuals should ingeneral not be subject to the public dose limit (see Section 7.6).
(249) In addition to the limits on eﬀective dose, limits were set in Publication 60 for
the lens of the eye and localised areas of skin because these tissues will not necessarily
be protected against tissue reactions by the limit on eﬀective dose. The relevant val-ues were set out in terms of the equivalent dose. These dose limits remain unchanged(see Table 6). However, new data on the radiosensitivity of the eye with regard tovisual impairment are expected. The Commission will consider these data and theirpossible signiﬁcance for the equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye when theybecome available. Because of the uncertainty concerning this risk, there should beparticular emphasis on optimisation in situations of exposure of the eyes.
(250) The dose limits for tissues are given in equivalent dose. The reason for this is
that the Commission assumes that the relevant RBE values for the deterministiceﬀects are always lower than w
Rvalues for stochastic eﬀects. It is, thus, safely
inferred that the dose limits provide at least as much protection against high-LETradiation as against low-LET radiation. The Commission, therefore, believes thatit is suﬃciently conservative to use w
Rwith regard to deterministic eﬀects. In special
situations where high-LET radiation is the critical factor and where it predominantlyexposes a single tissue (such as the skin), it will be more appropriate to express the
exposure in terms of the absorbed dose and to take into account the appropriate
RBE (see Annex B). To avoid confusion, it is necessary to clearly mention wheneveran RBE-weighted absorbed dose in Gy is used.
(251) The Commission’s multi-attribute approach to the selection of dose limits
necessarily includes societal judgements applied to the many attributes of risk. Thesejudgements would not necessarily be the same in all contexts and, in particular,might be diﬀerent in diﬀerent societies. It is for this reason that the Commission in-tends its guidance to be suﬃciently ﬂexible to allow for national or regional varia-
tions. In the Commission’s view, however, any such variations in the protection of
the most highly exposed individuals are best introduced by the use of source-relateddose constraints selected by regulatory authorities and applied in the process of opti-misation of protection.

1016. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMISSION’S RECOMMENDATIONS
(252) The previous chapter describes the Commission’s system of protection to be
applied in all situations requiring a decision on the control of radiation exposures.This chapter addresses the implementation of the system in the three types of exposure
situations: planned, emergency, and existing. Particular attention is focused on areas
where implementation of the Recommendations may not be immediately straightfor-ward. In a number of these areas, there is further guidance from the Commission asindicated in the text. A section comparing the radiological protection criteria in theseRecommendations with those in the previous Recommendations, Publication 60
(ICRP, 1991b) and derivative publications, is included. The last section of this chapteraddresses common aspects of the implementation of the Commission’s Recommenda-tions, notably the responsibilities of the users and regulatory authorities.
6.1. Planned exposure situations
(253) Planned exposure situations are where radiological protection can be planned
in advance, before exposures occur, and where the magnitude and extent of the expo-sures can be reasonably predicted. The term encompasses sources and situations thathave been appropriately managed within the Commission’s previous recommenda-tions for practices. In introducing a planned exposure situation all aspects relevant
to radiological protection should be considered. These aspects will include, as appro-
priate, design, construction, operation, decommissioning, waste management, andrehabilitation of previously occupied land and installations, and will take accountof potential exposures as well as normal exposures. Planned exposure situations alsoinclude the medical exposure of patients, including their comforters and carers. Theprinciples of protection for planned situations also apply to planned work in connec-tion with existing and emergency exposure situations, once the emergency has beenbrought under control. Recommendations for planned situations are substantially
unchanged from those provided in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) and subsequent pub-
lications for the normal operation of practices and protection in medicine. Because ofits speciﬁc characteristics, medical exposure is discussed separately in Chapter 7.
(254) All categories of exposure can occur in planned exposure situations, i.e.,
occupational exposure (Section 6.1.1), public exposure (Section 6.1.2), and medicalexposure of patients, including their comforters and carers (Chapter 7). The designand development of planned situations should have proper regard for potentialexposures that may result from deviations from normal operating conditions. Due
attention should be paid to the assessment of potential exposures and to the related
issue of the safety and security of radiation sources (Section 6.1.3).
6.1.1. Occupational exposure
(255) The Commission has previously recommended general principles for the
radiological protection of workers ( Publication 75 , ICRP, 1997a). These principles
remain valid.
103(256) The Commission continues to recommend that occupational exposure in
planned exposure situations be controlled by the procedures of optimisation belowa source-related constraint (see Section 5.9.1) and the use of prescriptive dose limits(see Section 5.10). A constraint should be deﬁned at the design stage of a planned expo-sure situation for its operation. For many types of work in planned exposure situa-
tions, it is possible to reach conclusions about the level of individual doses likely to
be incurred in well-managed operations. This information can then be used to estab-lish a dose constraint for that type of work. This work should be speciﬁed in fairlybroad terms, such as work in industrial radiography, the routine operation of nuclearpower plants, or work in medical establishments. However, there may also be morespeciﬁc situations where a constraint can be established to guide particular activities.
(257) It will usually be appropriate for such dose constraints to be set at the oper-
ational level. When using a dose constraint, a designer should specify the sources to
which the constraint is linked so as to avoid confusion with other sources to which
the workforce might be concurrently exposed. The source-related dose constraint foroccupational exposure in planned situations should be set to ensure that the doselimit is not exceeded (see Section 5.10). Experience gained in managing workers ex-posed to radiation will inform the choice of a value for a constraint for occupationalexposure. For this reason, large established organisations, having a comprehensiveradiological protection infrastructure, will often set their own constraints for occu-pational exposure. Smaller organisations with less relevant experience may require
further guidance on this topic from the appropriate expert bodies or regulatory
authorities. Nevertheless, the overall responsibility for setting constraints lies withthose who are responsible for worker exposure.
(258) Protection of transient or itinerant workers requires particular attention
because of the potential shared responsibility of several employers and licensees.In addition, sometimes several regulatory authorities are involved. Such workers in-clude contractors for maintenance operations in nuclear power plants and industrialradiographers, who are not on the staﬀ of the operator. In order to provide for their
protection, adequate consideration needs to be given to the previous exposures of
these workers so as to ensure that dose limits are also respected, and their exposureshould be followed up. Thus there should be an adequate degree of co-operationbetween the employer of the itinerant worker and the operators of the plants forwhom contracts are being undertaken. Regulatory authorities should ensure thatregulations are adequate in this respect.
6.1.2. Public exposure
(259) In planned exposure situations, the Commission continues to recommend
that public exposure be controlled by the procedures of optimisation below thesource-related constraint and by the use of dose limits. In general, especially for pub-lic exposure, each source will cause a distribution of doses over many individuals, sothe concept of a Representative Person should be used to represent the more highly
exposed individuals (ICRP, 2006a). Constraints for members of the public inICRP Publication 103
104planned exposure situations should be smaller than public dose limits, and would
typically be set by the national regulatory authorities.
(260) For the control of public exposure from waste disposal, the Commission has
previously recommended that a value for the dose constraint for members of thepublic of no more than about 0.3 mSv in a year would be appropriate (ICRP,
1997d). These Recommendations were further elaborated for the planned disposal
of long-lived radioactive waste in Publication 81 (ICRP, 1998b).
(261) In Publication 82 (ICRP, 1999a), the Commission issued guidance that in cir-
cumstances where there are planned discharges of long-lived radionuclides to theenvironment, planning assessments should consider whether build-up in the environ-ment would result in the constraint being exceeded, taking account of any reasonablecombination and build-up of exposures. Where such veriﬁcation considerations arenot possible or are too uncertain, it would be prudent to apply a dose constraint of
the order of 0.1 mSv in a year to the prolonged component of the dose attributable
to the long-lived artiﬁcial radionuclides. In planned exposure situations involvingnatural radioactive material, this limitation is not feasible and not required (ICRP,1999a). These Recommendations remain valid. In order to ensure that the build-upof annual doses from continuing practices does not cause dose limits to be exceededin the future, the dose commitment can be used (ICRP, 1991b, IAEA, 2000b). This isthe total dose that would eventually result from an event, such as a year of a plannedactivity causing discharges. Some ﬂexibility may be required for particular situations
involving long-lived natural radionuclides, such as past mining and milling activities
(see Sections 2.3 and 5.2.2 of Publication 82 , ICRP, 1999a).
6.1.3. Potential exposures
(262) In planned exposure situations, a certain level of exposure is reasonably ex-
pected to occur. However, higher exposures may arise following deviations fromplanned operating procedures, accidents including the loss of control of radiation
sources, and malevolent events. Such exposures are not planned to occur, although
the situation is planned. These exposures are referred to by the Commission aspotential exposures . Deviations from planned operating procedures and accidents
can often be foreseen and their probability of occurrence estimated, but they cannotbe predicted in detail. Loss of control of radiation sources and malevolent events areless predictable and call for a speciﬁc approach.
(263) There is usually an interaction between potential exposures and the expo-
sures arising from planned operations in normal operation; for example, actions
taken to reduce the exposure during normal operations may increase the probability
of potential exposures. Thus, the storage of long-lived waste rather than its dispersalcould reduce the exposures from discharges but would increase potential exposures.In order to control potential exposure, certain surveillance and maintenance activi-ties will be undertaken. These activities may increase normal exposures.
(264) Potential exposures should be considered at the planning stage of the intro-
duction of a planned exposure situation. It should be recognised that the potentialICRP Publication 103
105for exposures may lead to actions both to reduce the probability of the events occur-
ring, and to limit and reduce the exposure (mitigation) if any event were to occur(ICRP, 1991b, 1997b). Due consideration should be aﬀorded to potential exposuresduring application of the principles of justiﬁcation and optimisation.
(265) Potential exposure broadly covers three types of events.
/C15Events where the potential exposures would primarily aﬀect individuals who are
also subject to planned exposures: The number of individuals is usually small,and the detriment involved is the health risk to the directly exposed persons.The processes by which such exposures occur are relatively simple, e.g., the poten-
tial unsafe entry into an irradiation room. The Commission has given speciﬁc
guidance for the protection from potential exposures in such circumstances inPublication 76 (ICRP, 1997b). This guidance remains valid. Some additional
examples are discussed in Section 7.5 on accidents in medical contexts.
/C15Events where the potential exposures could aﬀect a larger number of people and
not only involve health risks but also other detriments, such as contaminated landand the need to control food consumption: The mechanisms involved are compli-cated and an example is the potential for a major accident in a nuclear reactor or
the malicious use of radioactive material. The Commission has provided a con-
ceptual framework for the protection from such type of events in Publication 64
(ICRP, 1993a). This framework remains valid. In Publication 96 (ICRP, 2005a),
the Commission provides some additional advice concerning radiological protec-tion after events involving malicious intent.
/C15Events in which the potential exposures could occur far in the future, and the
doses be delivered over long time periods, e.g., in the case of solid waste disposalin deep repositories: Considerable uncertainties surround exposures taking place
in the far future. Thus dose estimates should not be regarded as measures of
health detriment beyond times of around several hundreds of years into thefuture. Rather, they represent indicators of the protection aﬀorded by the disposalsystem. The Commission has given speciﬁc guidance for the disposal of long-livedsolid radioactive waste in Publication 81 (ICRP, 1998b). This guidance remains
valid.
Assessment of potential exposures
(266) The evaluation of potential exposures, for the purpose of planning or judg-
ing protection measures, is usually based on: a) the construction of scenarios whichare intended typically to represent the sequence of events leading to the exposures;b) the assessment of probabilities of each of these sequences; c) the assessment of
the resulting dose; d) the evaluation of detriment associated with that dose; e) com-
parison of the results with some criterion of acceptability; and f) optimisation of pro-tection which may require several iterations of the previous steps.
(267) The principles of constructing and analysing scenarios are well known and
are often used in engineering. Their application was discussed in Publication 76
(ICRP, 1997b). Decisions on the acceptability of potential exposures should takeaccount of both the probability of occurrence of the exposure and its magnitude.In some circumstances, decisions can be made by separate consideration of theseICRP Publication 103
106two factors. In other circumstances, it is useful to consider the individual probability
of radiation-related death, rather than the eﬀective dose (ICRP, 1997b). For this pur-pose, the probability is deﬁned as the product of the probability of incurring the dosein a year and the lifetime probability of radiation-related death from the dose con-ditional on the dose being incurred. The resulting probability can then be compared
with a risk constraint. If the probability is lower than the risk constraint, it may be
tolerated. Both of these approaches are discussed in the Commission’s Recommen-dations for the disposal of long-lived solid radioactive waste in Publication 81 (ICRP,
1998b).
(268) Risk constraints, like dose constraints, are source-related and in principle
should equate to a similar health risk to that implied by the corresponding dose con-straints for the same source. However, there can be large uncertainties in estimationsof the probability of an unsafe situation and the resulting dose. Thus, it will often be
suﬃcient to use a generic value for a risk constraint. In the case of workers, this
could be based on generalisations about normal occupational exposures, rather thanon a more speciﬁc study of the particular operation. Where the Commission’s systemof dose limitation has been applied and protection is optimised, annual occupationaleﬀective doses to an average individual may be as high as about 5 mSv in certain se-lected types of operation (UNSCEAR, 2000). For potential exposures of workers,the Commission therefore continues to recommend a generic risk constraint of21 0
/C04per year which is similar to the probability of fatal cancer associated with
an average occupational annual dose of 5 mSv (ICRP, 1997b). For potential expo-
sures of the public, the Commission continues to recommend a risk constraint of 110
/C05per year.
(269) The use of probability assessment is limited by the extent that unlikely events
can be forecast. In circumstances where accidents can occur as a result of a widespectrum of initiating events, caution should be exercised over any estimate of over-all probabilities because of the serious uncertainty of predicting the existence of allthe unlikely initiating events. In many circumstances, more information can be ob-
tained for decision-making purposes by considering the probability of occurrence
and the resultant doses separately.
(270) In large nuclear installations, dose criteria as a design basis of accident pre-
vention and mitigation may be prescribed by the regulatory agency for selected po-tential exposure scenarios. The dose criteria applied here for the potential exposureshould be derived from the risk constraints by taking account of the probability ofthe accident.
Safety and security of radiation sources and malevolent events
(271) Potential exposures associated with planned exposure situations may result
from the loss of control of radiation sources. This situation has received a growingattention over recent years and deserves a special consideration from the Commis-sion. The Recommendations of the Commission presume that, as a precondition
for adequate radiological protection, radiation sources are subject to proper security
measures (ICRP, 1991b). The control of radiation exposure in all planned exposuresituations is exercised by the application of controls at the source rather than in theICRP Publication 103
107environment. The Commission’s view is reﬂected in the International Basic Safety
Standards (BSS), which require that the control of sources shall not be relinquishedunder any circumstances (IAEA, 1996). The BSS also requires that sources be keptsecure so as to prevent theft or damage. In addition, the Code of Conduct on theSafety and Security of Radioactive Sources establishes basic principles applicable
to the security of radioactive sources (IAEA, 2004). The Commission supports the
global strengthening of the control of radiation sources.
(272) Security of radioactive sources is a necessary, but not suﬃcient, condition to
ensure source safety. Radioactive sources can be secure, i.e., under proper control,for instance preventing malicious use of the sources, and still not safe, i.e., proneto accidents. Thus the Commission has historically included aspects of security inits system of protection (ICRP, 1991b). In the context of safety, security provisionsare generally limited to general controls necessary to prevent loss, access, unauthor-
ised possession or transfer and use of the material, devices or installations. Measures
to ensure that the control of radioactive material and access to radiation devices andinstallations are not relinquished are also essential to maintain safety.
(273) The Commission’s 1990 Recommendations did not give attention to mea-
sures speciﬁcally to protect against terrorism or other malicious acts. However, ithas become evident that radiation safety must also include the potential for suchscenarios. Past experience with unintentional breaches in source security, or wherea discarded or orphan source was found by individuals unaware of the radiation
hazard, indicates what might occur if radioactive materials are used intentionally
to cause harm, e.g., by deliberate dispersion of radioactive material in a public area.Such events have the potential for exposing people to radiation and causing signif-icant environmental contamination, which would require speciﬁc radiological pro-tection measures (ICRP, 2005a).
6.2. Emergency exposure situations
(274) Even if all reasonable steps have been taken during the design stage to reduce
the probability and consequences of potential exposures, such exposures may need tobe considered in relation to emergency preparedness and response. Emergency expo-sure situations are unexpected situations that may require urgent protective actions,and perhaps also longer-term protective actions, to be implemented. Exposure ofmembers of the public or of workers, as well as environmental contamination canoccur in these situations. Exposures can be complex in the sense that they may resultfrom several independent pathways, perhaps acting simultaneously. Furthermore,
radiological hazards may be accompanied by other hazards (chemical, physical,
etc.). Response actions should be planned because potential emergency exposure sit-uations can be assessed in advance, to a greater or lesser accuracy depending uponthe type of installation or situation being considered. However, because actual emer-gency exposure situations are inherently unpredictable, the exact nature of necessaryprotection measures cannot be known in advance but must ﬂexibly evolve to meetactual circumstances. The complexity and variability of these situations give themICRP Publication 103
108a unique character that merits their speciﬁc treatment by the Commission in its
Recommendations.
(275) The Commission has set out general principles for planning intervention in
the case of a radiation emergency in Publications 60 and 63(ICRP, 1991b, 1992).
Additional relevant advice is given in Publications 86, 96, 97, and 98(ICRP,
2000c, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c). While the general principles and additional advice re-
main valid, the Commission is now extending its guidance on the application of pro-tective measures on the basis of recent developments in emergency preparedness andof experience since publication of its previous advice.
(276) The Commission now emphasises the importance of justifying and optimis-
ing protection strategies for application in emergency exposure situations, the opti-misation process being guided by reference levels (see Section 5.9). The possibility ofmultiple, independent, simultaneous, and time-varying exposure pathways makes it
important to focus on the overall exposures that may occur from all pathways when
developing and implementing protective measures. As such, an overall protectionstrategy is necessary, generally including an assessment of the radiological situationand implementation of diﬀerent protective measures. These measures may well varywith time, as the emergency exposure situation evolves, and with place, as the emer-gency exposure situation may aﬀect distinct geographic areas diﬀerently. The overallexposure, which is projected to occur as a result of the emergency exposure situation,should no protective actions be employed, is called the projected dose . The dose that
would result when a protection strategy is implemented is called the residual dose .I n
addition, each protective measure will avert a certain amount of exposure. This isreferred to as averted dose , and is the concept for the optimisation of the individual
protective measures as given in Publication 63 (ICRP, 1992) that will make up the
overall protection strategy. The Commission now recommends focusing on optimi-sation with respect to the overall strategy, rather than the individual measures. How-ever, the levels of averted dose recommended in Publication 63 for optimisation of
protection in terms of individual protective measures may still be useful as inputs
to the development of the overall response (see also Publication 96 , ICRP, 2005a).
(277) In emergency exposure situations particular attention should be given to the
prevention of severe deterministic health eﬀects as doses could reach high levels in ashort period of time. In case of major emergencies an assessment based on healtheﬀects would be insuﬃcient and due considerations must be given to societal, eco-nomic and other consequences. Another important objective is to prepare, to the ex-tent practicable, for the resumption of societal and economic activities considered as‘normal’.
(278) In planning for emergency situations, reference levels should be applied in
the process of optimisation. Reference levels for the highest planned residual dosesin emergency situations are typically in the 20 mSv to 100 mSv band of projecteddose as presented in Section 5.9.3. Expected residual doses for the overall protectionstrategies are compared with the reference levels in initially assessing the suitabilityof the strategies. A protection strategy that would not reduce residual doses to belowthe reference levels should be rejected at the planning stage.ICRP Publication 103
109(279) Planning should result in a set of actions that would be implemented auto-
matically once an emergency exposure situation has occurred, should the actual cir-cumstances require such urgent actions. Following a decision on such immediateaction, the projected residual dose distribution can be assessed, and the referencelevel acts as a benchmark for assessing the eﬀectiveness of protection strategies
and the need to modify or take additional actions. All exposures above or below
the reference level should be subject to optimisation of protection, and particularattention should be given to exposures above the reference level.
(280) When preparing a protection strategy for a particular emergency exposure
situation, a number of diﬀerent populations, each needing speciﬁc protective mea-sures, may be identiﬁed. For example, the distance from the origin of an emergencyexposure situation (e.g., an installation, an emergency site) may be important interms of identifying the magnitude of exposures to be considered, and thus the types
and urgency of protective measures. With this diversity of exposed populations in
mind, the planning of protective measures should be based on exposures to the Rep-resentative Persons, as described in Publication 101 (ICRP, 2006a), from the various
populations that have been identiﬁed. After an emergency situation has occurred,planned protection measures should evolve to best address the actual conditionsof all exposed populations being considered. Particular attention should be givento pregnant women and children.
(281) Emergency plans should be developed (in more or less detail, as appropriate)
to cope with all possible scenarios. The development of an emergency plan (national,
local, or installation speciﬁc) is a multi-step iterative process that includes assess-ment, planning, resource allocation, training, exercises, audit, and revision. The radi-ation emergency response plans should be integrated into all-hazards emergencymanagement programmes.
(282) In the event that an emergency exposure situation occurs, the ﬁrst issue is to
recognise its onset. The initial response should be to follow the emergency plan in aconsistent but ﬂexible way. The protection strategy initially implemented will be that
described in the emergency plan for the relevant event scenario, based on the generic
optimisation undertaken as part of the planning stage. Once the measures in theemergency plan have been initiated, emergency response can be characterised byan iterative cycle of review, planning, and execution.
(283) Emergency response is inevitably a process that develops in time from a sit-
uation of little information to one of potentially overwhelming information, with theexpectations for protection and involvement by those aﬀected similarly increasingrapidly with time. As discussed in Publication 96 (ICRP, 2005a), three phases of
an emergency exposure situation are considered: the early phase (which may be di-
vided into a warning and possible release phase), the intermediate phase (whichstarts with the cessation of any release and regaining control of the source of re-leases), and the late phase. At any stage, decision-makers will necessarily have anincomplete understanding of the situation regarding the future impact, the eﬀective-ness of protective measures, and the concerns of those directly and indirectly af-fected, amongst other factors. An eﬀective response must therefore be developedﬂexibly with regular review of its impact. The reference level provides an importantICRP Publication 103
110input to this review, providing a benchmark against which what is known about the
situation and the protection aﬀorded by implemented measures can be compared.The management of long-term contamination resulting from an emergency situationis treated as an existing exposure situation (see Section 6.3).
6.3. Existing exposure situations
(284) Existing exposure situations are those that already exist when a decision on
control has to be taken. There are many types of existing exposure situations thatmay cause exposures high enough to warrant radiological protective actions, or atleast their consideration. Radon in dwellings or the workplace, and naturally occur-ring radioactive material (NORM) are well-known examples. It may also be neces-sary to take radiological protection decisions concerning existing man-made
exposure situations such as residues in the environment resulting from radiological
emissions from operations that were not conducted within the Commission’s systemof protection, or contaminated land resulting from an accident or a radiologicalevent. There are also existing exposure situations for which it will be obvious thataction to reduce exposures is not warranted. The decision as to what componentsof existing exposure are not amenable to control requires a judgement by the regu-latory authority that will depend on the controllability of the source or exposure,and also on the prevailing economic, societal, and cultural circumstances. Principles
for exclusion and exemption of radiation sources are presented and discussed in
Section 2.3.
(285) Existing exposure situations can be complex in that they may involve several
exposure pathways and they generally give rise to wide distributions of annual indi-vidual doses ranging from the very low to, in rare cases, several tens of millisieverts.Such situations often involve dwellings, for example in the case of radon, and inmany cases the behaviour of the exposed individuals determines the level of expo-sure. Another example is the distribution of individual exposures in a long-term con-
taminated territory, which directly reﬂects diﬀerences in the dietary habits of the
aﬀected inhabitants. The multiplicity of exposure pathways and the importance ofindividual behaviour may result in exposure situations that are diﬃcult to control.
(286) The Commission recommends that reference levels, set in terms of individual
dose, should be used in conjunction with the implementation of the optimisationprocess for exposures in existing exposure situations. The objective is to implementoptimised protection strategies, or a progressive range of such strategies, which willreduce individual doses to below the reference level. However, exposures below the
reference level should not be ignored; these exposure circumstances should also be
assessed to ascertain whether protection is optimised, or whether further protectivemeasures are needed. An endpoint for the optimisation process must not be ﬁxed apriori and the optimised level of protection will depend on the situation. It is theresponsibility of regulatory authorities to decide on the legal status of the referencelevel, which is implemented to control a given situation. Retrospectively, when pro-tective actions have been implemented, reference levels may also be used as bench-marks for assessing the eﬀectiveness of the protection strategies. The use ofICRP Publication 103
111reference levels in an existing situation is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows the evo-
lution of the distribution of individual doses with time as a result of the optimisationprocess.
(287) Reference levels for existing exposure situations should be set typically in the
1 mSv to 20 mSv band of projected dose as presented in Sections 5.9.2 and 5.9.3 and
Table 5. The individuals concerned should receive general information on the expo-
sure situation and the means of reducing their doses. In situations where individuallife-styles are key drivers of the exposures, individual monitoring or assessment aswell as education and training may be important requirements. Living on contami-nated land after a nuclear accident or a radiological event is a typical situation ofthat sort.
(288) The main factors to be considered for setting the reference levels for existing
exposure situations are the feasibility of controlling the situation, and the past expe-
rience with the management of similar situations. In most existing exposure situa-
tions, there is a desire from the exposed individual, as well as from the authorities,to reduce exposures to levels that are close to or similar to situations consideredas ‘normal’. This applies particularly in situations of exposures from material result-ing from human actions, e.g., NORM residues and contamination from accidents.
6.3.1. Indoor radon in dwellings and workplaces
(289) Exposure to radon in dwellings and workplaces may arise from existing
exposure situations or from practices, e.g., storage or processing of monazite sands.The Commission has previously made speciﬁc recommendations in relation to radonexposure (ICRP, 1993b). Since then, several epidemiological studies have conﬁrmedthe risk of radon-222 exposure even at relatively moderate concentrations (UNSCE-AR, 2008). European, North American, and Chinese residential case-control studiesalso demonstrate a signiﬁcant association between the risk of lung cancer and expo-sure to residential radon-222 (Darby et al., 2006, Krewski et al., 2006, Lubin et al.,
2004). These studies have generally provided support for the Commission’s Recom-
mendations on protection against radon.
(290) There is now a remarkable coherence between the risk estimates developed
from epidemiological studies of miners and residential case-control radon studies.While the miner studies provide a strong basis for evaluating risks from radon expo-sure and for investigating the eﬀects of modiﬁers to the dose–response relation, theresults of the recent pooled residential studies now provide a direct method of esti-mating risks to people at home without the need for extrapolation from miner stud-
ies (UNSCEAR, 2008).
(291) The Commission’s view on radon risk assessment has, until now, been that it
should incorporate epidemiological studies of miners. Given the wealth of data nowavailable on domestic exposure to radon, the Commission recommends that the esti-mation of risk from domestic radon exposure should include the results of pooledresidential case control radon-222 studies. However, there is still great value in theminer epidemiology studies for investigating dose response relationships and con-founding eﬀects of smoking and exposure to other agents. The currently availableICRP Publication 103
112epidemiological evidence indicates that risks other than lung cancer from exposure to
radon-222 (and decay products) are likely to be small.
(292) The underlying theme of the Commission’s Recommendations on radon is
the controllability of exposure. The ability to control exposure distinguishes the cir-cumstances under which exposure to radon in workplaces, including undergroundmines, may need to be subject to the Commission’s system of protection and wherethe need for action to limit radon exposure in dwellings should be considered. There
Fig. 4. The use of a reference level in an existing exposure situation and the evolution of the distribution of
individual doses with time as a result of the optimisation process.ICRP Publication 103
113are several reasons for treating radon-222 in this separate manner. The exposure
route diﬀers from that of other natural sources, and there are dosimetric and epi-demiological issues speciﬁc to radon-222. For many individuals radon-222 is animportant source of exposure which, in principle, can be controlled. The Commis-sion issued the current recommendations for protection against radon-222 at home
and at work in Publication 65 (ICRP, 1993b). The policy has found wide acceptance
and the present Recommendations broadly continue the same policy, with an adap-tation to the new approach based on exposure situations and where a central role isgiven to the optimisation principle and the use of reference levels.
(293) In Publication 65 (ICRP, 1993b), the policy was based upon ﬁrst setting a
level to an eﬀective dose of 10 mSv per year from radon-222 where action wouldalmost certainly be warranted to reduce the exposure. Regulatory authorities wereexpected to apply the optimisation of protection in a generic way to ﬁnd a lower level
at which to act, in the range from 3 to 10 mSv. The eﬀective dose was converted by a
dose conversion convention into a value of radon-222 concentration, which was dif-ferent between homes and workplaces largely because of the diﬀerent number ofhours spent at each. For dwellings this range was a radon concentration of 200–600 Bq m
/C03, while the corresponding range for workplaces was 500–1500 Bq m/C03.
The result of the optimisation was to set action levels, i.e., levels above which actionwas required to reduce the dose.
(294) The Commission now recommends applying the source-related principles of
radiological protection for controlling radon exposure. This means that national
authorities need to set national reference levels to aid the optimisation of protection.Even though the nominal risk per Sv has changed slightly, the Commission, for thesake of continuity and practicality, retains the upper value of 10 mSv for the individ-ual dose reference level, and the corresponding activity concentrations as given inPublication 65 (ICRP, 1993b). Thus, the upper values for the reference level ex-
pressed in activity concentrations remain at 1500 Bq m
/C03for workplaces and 600
Bq m/C03for homes (Table 7).
(295) It is the responsibility of the appropriate national authorities, as with other
sources, to establish their own national reference levels, taking into account the pre-vailing economic and societal circumstances and then to apply the process of optimi-sation of protection in their country. All reasonable eﬀorts should be made to reduceradon-222 exposures in homes and at work places to below the reference levels thatare set at the national level and to a level where protection can be considered opti-mised. The actions taken should be intended to produce substantial reduction inradon exposures. It is not suﬃcient to adopt marginal improvements aimed only

114at reducing the radon concentrations to a value just below the national reference
level.
(296) The implementation of the optimisation process should result in concentra-
tion activities below the national reference levels. In general, no further action will berequired apart from perhaps monitoring activity concentration sporadically to en-
sure that levels remain low. National authorities should, however, periodically re-
view the values of the national reference levels for radon exposure to ensure thatthey remain appropriate.
(297) Responsibility for taking action against radon in houses and other premises
will often fall on the individual owners, who cannot be expected to carry out a de-tailed optimisation exercise for each property. Therefore, in addition to reference lev-els, regulatory authorities may also wish to specify levels at which protection againstradon-222 can be considered optimised, i.e., where no further action is needed. The
Commission’s view continues to be that there is merit in deﬁning radon-prone areas
in which the concentration of radon in buildings is likely to be higher than is typicalof the country as a whole. This allows attention to be focused on radon where it ismost exigent and action to be concentrated where it is most likely to be eﬀective(ICRP, 1993b).
(298) Radon exposure at work at levels above the national reference level should
be considered part of occupational exposure whereas exposures at levels belowshould not. In the interest of international harmonisation of occupational safety
standards, a single action level value of 1000 Bq m
/C03was established in the BSS
(IAEA, 1996). For the same reasons, the Commission considers that this internation-ally established value, which is a reference value in current terminology, might beused globally to deﬁne the entry point for occupational protection requirementsfor exposure situations to radon. In fact, this international level serves as a muchneeded globally harmonised monitoring and record-keeping system. This is relevantfor determining when the occupational radiological protection requirements apply –i.e., what is actually included within the system of regulatory control. On this basis
the BSS establishes limits on intake and exposures for radon and thoron progeny
(see Table II.1 in IAEA, 1996).
6.4. Protection of the embryo/fetus in emergency and existing exposure situation
(299) In Publication 82 (ICRP, 1999a), the Commission concluded that prenatal
exposure would not be a speciﬁc protection case, i.e., would not require protectiveactions other than those aimed at the general population. The protection of the em-
bryo/fetus and infants is discussed in Section 5.4.1. In Publication 82 (ICRP, 1999a),
the Commission provided practical recommendations concerning in-utero exposures.Dose coeﬃcients for the embryo/fetus due to intakes of radionuclides by the motherwere provided in Publication 88 (ICRP, 2001a). The Commission’s conclusion in
Publication 90 (ICRP, 2003a) was that newly available information on in-utero risk
at low doses (up to a few tens of mSv) supported the advice developed in Publications
60,82,84,a n d 88(ICRP 1991b, 1999a, 2000a, 2001a). The Commission position on
these issues remains unchanged.ICRP Publication 103
1156.5. Comparison of radiological protection criteria
(300) The current recommended values for protection criteria are compared in
Table 8 with those provided by the previous Recommendations in Publication 60
(ICRP, 1991b) and the derivative publications. The comparison shows that the cur-
rent Recommendations are essentially the same as the previous Recommendations
for planned exposure situations. In the case of existing and emergency exposuresituations, the current Recommendations generally encompass the previous valuesbut are wider in their scope of application. It should be noted that in some casesthe values cited are in diﬀerent quantities; for example, in emergency exposure situ-

6.6. Practical implementation
(301) This section addresses the general implementation of the Commission’s Rec-
ommendations, dealing with factors which are common to the three types of expo-sure situations. It focuses on organisational features that may help in theimplementation of the Commission’s Recommendations. Since the organisationalstructures will diﬀer from country to country, the chapter is illustrative rather thanexhaustive. The International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy
Agency of OECD issue further advice on the infrastructure required for radiological
protection in various circumstances to their member states (e.g., see IAEA, 1996,2000a, 2002, and NEA, 2005). Generic advice on organisation for health and safetyat work is provided by the International Labour Organization, the World HealthOrganization and the Pan-American Health Organization.
6.6.1. The infrastructure for radiological protection and safety
(302) An infrastructure is required to ensure that an appropriate standard of pro-
tection is maintained. This infrastructure includes at least a legal framework, a reg-ulatory authority, the operating management of any undertaking involving ionisingradiation (including the design, operation, and decommissioning of equipment andinstallations as well as adventitious enhancement of natural radiation including avi-ation and space ﬂight), and the employees at such undertakings. It may include addi-tional organisations and persons responsible for protection and safety.
(303) The legal framework must provide for the regulation, as required, of under-
takings involving ionising radiation and for the clear assignment of responsibilities
for protection and safety. A regulatory authority must be responsible for theregulatory control, whenever required, of undertakings involving radiation and forthe enforcement of the regulations. This regulatory authority must be clearlyseparate from organisations that conduct or promote activities causing radiationexposure.
(304) The nature of radiological hazards necessitates a number of special features
in the legal framework and the provision of expertise within the regulatory author-
ity. The important issues are that radiological questions are addressed properly,
that the appropriate expertise is available, and that decisions concerning radiationsafety cannot be unduly inﬂuenced by economic or other non-radiologicalconsiderations.
(305) The primary responsibility for achieving and maintaining a satisfactory con-
trol of radiation exposures rests on the management bodies of the institutions con-ducting the operations giving rise to the exposures. When equipment or plant isdesigned and supplied by other institutions, they, in turn, have a responsibility toICRP Publication 103
118see that the items supplied will be satisfactory, if used as intended. Governments
have the responsibility to set up national authorities, which then have the responsi-bility for providing a regulatory, and often also an advisory, framework to empha-sise the responsibilities of the management bodies while, at the same time, settingand enforcing overall standards of protection. They may also have to take direct
responsibility when, as with exposures to many natural sources, there is no relevant
management body.
(306) There are various reasons why there may not be a relevant operating man-
agement available. For instance, the radiation may not have been caused by anyhuman actions, or an activity may have been abandoned and the proprietors couldhave disappeared. In such cases, the national regulatory authority, or some otherdesignated body, will have to accept some of the responsibilities usually carried bythe operating management.
(307) In all organisations, the responsibilities and the associated authority are del-
egated to an extent depending on the complexity of the duties involved. The workingof this delegation should be examined regularly. However, the management of theorganisation remains accountable for the provision of adequate radiological protec-tion, and the delegation of tasks and responsibilities does not detract from thataccountability. There should be a clear line of accountability running right to thetop of each organisation. There is also an interaction between the various kinds oforganisation. Advisory and regulatory authorities should be held accountable for
the advice they give and any requirements they impose.
(308) Requirements, operating instructions, regulatory approvals and licences, and
other administrative devices are not, of themselves, enough to achieve an appropri-ate standard of radiological protection. Everyone in an activity, from the individualworkers and their representatives to the senior management, should regard protec-tion and emergency prevention as integral parts of their everyday functions. Successand failure in these areas are at least as important as they are in the primary functionof the activity.
(309) The imposition of requirements expressed in general terms and the accep-
tance of advice do not reduce the responsibility, or the accountability, of the oper-ating organisations. This is also true in principle of prescriptive requirements,where the regulatory authority prescribes in detail how protection standards are tobe maintained. However, prescriptive requirements concerning the conduct of oper-ations result in some de facto transfer of responsibility and accountability from theuser to the regulatory authority. In the long run, they also reduce the user’s incentivefor self-improvement. Therefore, it is usually better to adopt a regulatory regime that
places a more explicit responsibility on the user, and forces the user to convince the
regulatory authority that adequate protection methods and standards are used andmaintained.
(310) Therefore, the use of prescriptive requirements should always be carefully
justiﬁed. In any event, they should never be regarded as an alternative to the processof optimising protection. It is not satisfactory to set design or operational limits ortargets as an arbitrary fraction of the dose limit, regardless of the particular nature ofthe plant and the operations.ICRP Publication 103
1196.6.2. External expertise and advice; delegation of authority
(311) The prime responsibility for radiological protection and radiation safety in
an undertaking involving ionising radiation rests with the operating organisation.In order to assume this responsibility, the organisation needs expertise in radiolog-
ical protection. It is not always necessary or reasonable to demand that this expertise
is available within the operating organisation. As an alternative, it may be acceptableand recommendable for the operating organisation to use consultants and advisoryorganisations, particularly if the operating organisation is small and the complexityof the radiological protection issues is limited.
(312) Such an arrangement will not in any way relieve the operating organisation
of its responsibility. The role of a consultant or an advisory organisation will be toprovide information and advice as necessary. It still remains the responsibility of the
operating management to take decisions and actions on the basis of such advice, and
individual employees still need to adhere to a ‘safety culture’, constantly askingthemselves whether they have done all that they reasonably can to achieve a safeoperation.
(313) Similarly, the use of consultants or advisory bodies will not in any way
diminish or change the responsibility of the regulatory authority. Furthermore, itwill be particularly important when the regulatory authority uses consultants thatthese are free from any conﬂicts of interest and are able to provide impartial advice.
The need for transparency in decision making should also be kept in mind.
6.6.3. Incident reporting
(314) An accident and incident reporting routine with feedback to users is indis-
pensable in the prevention of emergencies. In order for such a system to work andachieve its goals, mutual trust is required. Licensing constitutes the formal conﬁrma-tion of a regulatory authority’s trust in a user. However, operating organisations
also need to be able to trust the regulatory authority. A primary requirement is that
all users are treated in a fair and equal manner. Honest reporting of a problem com-bined with immediate action to rectify the situation should be encouraged, notpunished.
6.6.4. Management requirements
(315) The ﬁrst, and in many ways the most important, of the practical steps in
implementing the Commission’s Recommendations is the establishment of a
safety-based attitude in everyone concerned with all the operations from design todecommissioning. This can only be achieved by a substantial commitment to train-ing and a recognition that safety is a personal responsibility and is of major concernto the top management.
(316) The explicit commitment of an organisation to safety should be made man-
ifest by written policy statements from the highest level of management, by the estab-lishment of formal management structures for dealing with radiological protection,ICRP Publication 103
120by issuing clear operating instructions, and by clear and demonstrable support for
those persons with direct responsibility for radiological protection in the workplaceand the environment ( Publication 75, ICRP, 1997a). To translate this commitment
into eﬀective action, senior management should identify appropriate design andoperational criteria, determine organisational arrangements, assign clear responsibil-
ities to put these policies into eﬀect, and establish a culture within which all those in
the organisation recognise the importance of restricting both normal and potentialexposures to ionising radiation.
(317) There should be plans for dealing with accidents and emergencies. These
plans should be subject to periodic review and exercise, and result in written manage-ment requirements. Planning for the event of emergencies should be an integral partof normal operating procedures. Any changes in responsibility, e.g., from the usualline of command to an emergency controller, should be planned in advance.
Requirements to, and mechanisms for, implementing lessons learned should be
established.
(318) The organisational approach should include involvement and participation
of all workers. It is sustained by eﬀective communications and the promotion ofcompetence that enables all employees to make a responsible and informed contribu-tion to the health and safety eﬀort. The visible and active leadership of senior man-agers is necessary to develop and maintain a culture supportive of health and safetymanagement. The aim is not simply to avoid accidents, but to motivate and empower
people to work safely. It is important that management ensures that mechanisms are
in place by which workers may provide feedback on radiological protection issues,and workers should be fully involved in developing methods to ensure that dosesare as low as reasonably achievable.
(319) Another common responsibility of the operating management is to provide
access to occupational services dealing with protection and health. The protectionservice should provide specialist advice and arrange any necessary monitoring pro-visions commensurate with the complexity of the operation and its potential hazards.
The head of the protection service should have direct access to the senior operating
management. The principal role of the occupational health service is the same as it isin any occupation.
6.6.5. Compliance with the intended standard of protection
(320) The measurement or assessment of radiation doses is fundamental to the
practice of radiological protection. Neither the equivalent dose in an organ nor
the eﬀective dose can be measured directly. Values of these quantities must be in-
ferred with the aid of models, usually involving environmental, metabolic, and dosi-metric components. Ideally, these models and the values chosen for their parametersshould be realistic, so that the results they give can be described as ‘best estimates’.Where practicable, estimates and discussion should be made of the uncertaintiesinherent in these results (see Section 4.4).
(321) All the organisations concerned with radiological protection should have a
duty to verify their compliance with their own objectives and procedures. TheICRP Publication 103
121operating management should establish a system for reviewing its organisational
structure and its procedures, a function analogous to ﬁnancial auditing. Nationalauthorities should conduct similar internal audits and should have the added dutyof, and authority for, assessing both the level of protection achieved by operatingmanagements and the degree of compliance with the regulatory provisions. All
these veriﬁcation procedures should include consideration of potential exposures
by a veriﬁcation of the safety provisions. Veriﬁcation procedures should includea review of quality assurance programmes and some form of inspection. However,inspection is a form of sampling – it cannot cover all eventualities. It is best seen asa mechanism for persuading those inspected to put, and keep, their own houses inorder.

1237. MEDICAL EXPOSURE OF PATIENTS, COMFORTERS AND CARERS,
AND VOLUNTEERS IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
(322) Medical exposures are predominantly delivered to individuals (patients)
undergoing diagnostic examinations, interventional procedures, or radiation
therapy. Other individuals caring for and comforting patients are also exposed to
radiation. These individuals include parents and others, normally family or closefriends, who hold children during diagnostic procedures or may come close topatients following the administration of radiopharmaceuticals or during brachyther-apy. Exposure to members of the general public from released patients alsooccurs, but this exposure is almost always very small. In addition, volunteers in bio-medical research often undergo medical procedures involving radiation exposurethat are similar to procedures performed on patients. Medical exposure refers to
all these types of exposures, and the present chapter, in particular, covers the
following:
/C15The exposure of individuals for diagnostic, interventional, and therapeutic pur-
poses, including exposure of the embryo/fetus or infant during medical exposure
of patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding;
/C15Exposures (other than occupational) incurred knowingly and willingly by individ-
uals such as family and close friends helping either in hospital or at home in thesupport and comfort of patients undergoing diagnosis or treatment;
/C15Exposures incurred by volunteers as part of a programme of biomedical research
that provides no direct beneﬁt to the volunteers.
(323) Radiation exposures of patients in medicine require an approach that diﬀers
from the radiological protection in other planned exposure situations. The exposureis intentional and for the direct beneﬁt of the patient. In radiation therapy, the bio-logical eﬀects of high-dose radiation (e.g., cell killing) are used for the beneﬁt of thepatient to treat cancer and other diseases. The application of the Commission’s Rec-
ommendations to the medical uses of radiation therefore requires separate guidance,
and medical exposure of patients is therefore dealt with in the present chapter.
(324) In diagnostic and interventional procedures, this means avoiding
unnecessary exposures, while in radiation therapy it requires delivery of the requireddose to the volume to be treated, avoiding unnecessary exposure of healthytissues.
(325) The objectives are the justiﬁcation of medical procedures and the optimisa-
tion of protection commensurate with the medical purposes. The Commission’s
Recommendations for radiological protection and safety in medicine are given in
Publication 73 (ICRP, 1996a ), and remain valid. These Recommendations note
important diﬀerences between the implementation of the system of protection inmedicine and its implementation in the other two categories of exposure (occupa-tional and public). These diﬀerences include the following.
/C15The principle of justiﬁcation applies at three levels in medicine as described in
Section 7.1.1.
125/C15In applying the principle of optimisation of protection of the patient, the beneﬁts
and detriments are received by the same individual, the patient, and the dose tothe patient is determined principally by the medical needs. Dose constraints forpatients are therefore inappropriate, in contrast to their importance in occupa-tional and public exposure. Nevertheless, some management of patient exposure
is needed and the use of diagnostic reference levels is recommended in Publication
73(ICRP, 1996a ) with further guidance in Supporting Guidance 2 (ICRP, 2001b ).
/C15The limitation of the dose to the individual patient is not recommended because it
may, by reducing the eﬀectiveness of the patient’s diagnosis or treatment, do moreharm than good. The emphasis is then on the justiﬁcation of the medical proce-dures and on the optimisation of protection.
(326) The basic framework for protection established in Publication 60 (ICRP,
1991b ) has been further elaborated in a series of publications described below.
The recommendations, guidance, and advice in these publications remain valid,forming part of an increasing library of medical exposure information provided bythe Commission [see also Publication 105 (ICRP, 2007b )].
(327) The exposure of patients is deliberate. Except in radiation therapy, it is not
the aim to deliver a radiation dose, but rather to use the radiation to provide diagnos-
tic information or to conduct an interventional procedure. Nevertheless, the dose isgiven deliberately and cannot be reduced indeﬁnitely without prejudicing the intendedoutcome. Medical uses of radiation are also voluntary in nature, combined with theexpectation of direct individual health beneﬁt to the patient. The patient, or legalguardian, agrees or consents to a medical procedure using radiation. This decisionis made with varying degrees of informed consent that includes not only the expectedbeneﬁt but also the potential risks (including radiation). The amount of information
provided in order to obtain informed consent varies based on the exposure level (e.g.,
whether diagnostic, interventional, or therapeutic) and on the possible emergent med-ical complications that may be attributable to radiation exposure.
(328) The physicians and other health professionals involved in the procedures
that irradiate patients should always be trained in the principles of radiological pro-tection, including the basic principles of physics and biology. The ﬁnal responsibilityfor the medical exposure of patients lies with the physician, who therefore should beaware of the risks and beneﬁts of the procedures involved.
(329) Medical exposures of patients to external radiation are commonly concerned
with limited parts of the body only, and it is important that medical staﬀ are fullyaware of the doses to normal tissue in the irradiated ﬁelds. Care has to be takenin such situations so that no undesirable tissue reactions occur.
7.1. Justiﬁcation for medical procedures
(330) Medical exposure of patients calls for a diﬀerent and more detailed approach
to the process of justiﬁcation. The medical use of radiation should be justiﬁed, as is
any other planned exposure situation, although that justiﬁcation lies usually with themedical profession rather than with government or regulatory authorities. The prin-ICRP Publication 103
126cipal aim of medical exposures is to do more good than harm to the patient, subsidi-
ary account being taken of the radiation detriment from the exposure of the radio-logical staﬀ and of other individuals. The responsibility for the justiﬁcation of the useof a particular procedure falls on the relevant medical practitioners. Justiﬁcation ofmedical procedures therefore remains a principal part of the Commission’s
Recommendations.
(331) The principle of justiﬁcation applies at three levels in the use of radiation in
medicine.
/C15At the ﬁrst level, the use of radiation in medicine is accepted as doing more good
than harm to the patient. This level of justiﬁcation can now be taken for granted
and is not discussed further below.
/C15At the second level, a speciﬁed procedure with a speciﬁed objective is deﬁned and
justiﬁed (e.g., chest radiographs for patients showing relevant symptoms, or agroup of individuals at risk to a condition that can be detected and treated).The aim of the second level of justiﬁcation is to judge whether the radiologicalprocedure will usually improve the diagnosis or treatment or will provide neces-sary information about the exposed individuals.
/C15At the third level, the application of the procedure to an individual patient should
be justiﬁed (i.e., the particular application should be judged to do more good thanharm to the individual patient). Hence all individual medical exposures should bejustiﬁed in advance, taking into account the speciﬁc objectives of the exposure andthe characteristics of the individual involved.
The second and third levels of justiﬁcation are discussed below.
7.1.1. The justiﬁcation of a deﬁned radiological procedure (level 2)
(332) The justiﬁcation of the radiological procedure is a matter for national and
international professional bodies, in conjunction with national health and radiologi-
cal protection authorities and the corresponding international organisations. The
possibility of accidental or unintended exposures should also be considered. The deci-sions should be reviewed from time to time, as more information becomes availableabout the risks and eﬀectiveness of the existing procedure and about new procedures.
7.1.2. The justiﬁcation of a procedure for an individual patient (level 3)
(333) Justiﬁcation of individual exposures should include checking that the
required information is not already available and that the proposed examination
is the most suitable method of providing the clinical information required. Forhigh-dose examinations, such as complex diagnostic and interventional procedures,individual justiﬁcation is particularly important and should take account of all avail-able information. This includes the details of the proposed procedure and of alterna-tive procedures, the characteristics of the individual patient, the expected dose to thepatient, and the availability of information on previous or expected examinations orICRP Publication 103
127treatment. It will often be possible to speed up the justiﬁcation process by deﬁning
referral criteria and patient categories in advance.
7.2. Optimisation of protection in medical exposures
(334) The Commission now uses the same conceptual approach in source-related
protection, irrespective of the type of source. In the case of exposure from diagnosticand interventional medical procedures, the diagnostic reference level has as its objec-
tive the optimisation of protection, but it is not implemented by constraints on indi-vidual patient doses. It is a mechanism to manage patient dose to be commensuratewith the medical purpose (see Section 7.2.1).
7.2.1. Diagnostic reference levels
(335) Diagnostic reference levels apply to radiation exposure of patients resulting
from procedures performed for medical imaging purposes. They do not apply toradiation therapy. Diagnostic reference levels have no direct linkage to the numericalvalues of the Commission’s dose limits or dose constraints. In practice, the values areselected on the basis of a percentile point on the observed distribution of doses topatients or to a reference patient. The values should be selected by professional med-ical bodies in conjunction with national health and radiological protection authori-
ties and reviewed at intervals that represent a compromise between the necessary
stability and the long-term changes in the observed dose distributions. The selectedvalues could be speciﬁc to a country or region.
(336) Diagnostic reference levels are used in medical imaging to indicate whether,
in routine conditions, the levels of patient dose from, or administered activity(amount of radioactive material) for, a speciﬁed imaging procedure are unusuallyhigh or low for that procedure. If so, a local review should be initiated to determinewhether protection has been adequately optimised or whether corrective action is re-
quired ( ICRP, 1996a ). The diagnostic reference level should be expressed as a readily
measurable patient-dose-related quantity for the speciﬁed procedure. Screening pro-grammes, such as mammography of asymptomatic women in the general popula-tion, may require diﬀerent diagnostic reference levels from the clinical use ofsimilar diagnostic methods. Additional guidance is given in Publication 105 (ICRP,
2007b ) and in Supporting Guidance 2 (ICRP, 2001b ).
(337) In principle, it might be possible to choose a lower diagnostic reference level
below which the doses would be too low to provide a suﬃciently good image quality.
However, such diagnostic reference levels are diﬃcult to set, because factors other
than dose also inﬂuence image quality. Nevertheless, if the observed doses or admin-istered activities are consistently far below the diagnostic reference level, there shouldbe a local review of the quality of the images obtained.
(338) Extensive information on the management of patient dose in ﬂuoroscopi-
cally guided interventional procedures, computed tomography and digital radiol-ogy is provided in Publications 85 ,87, and 93, respectively ( ICRP, 2000b, 2000d,
2004a ).ICRP Publication 103
1287.2.2. Radiation therapy
(339) In radiation therapy, optimisation involves not only delivering the pre-
scribed dose to the tumour, but also planning the protection of healthy tissues out-side the target volume. These radiation therapy issues are considered in Publication
44(ICRP, 1985a ).
7.3. Eﬀective dose in medical exposure
(340) The age distributions for workers and the general population (for which the
eﬀective dose is derived) can be quite diﬀerent from the overall age distribution forthe patients undergoing medical procedures using ionising radiation. The age distri-bution also diﬀers from one type of medical procedure to another, depending on theprevalence of the individuals for the medical condition being evaluated. For thesereasons, risk assessment for medical diagnosis and treatment using ionising radiation
is best evaluated using appropriate risk values for the individual tissues at risk and
for the age and sex distribution of the individuals undergoing the medical proce-dures. Eﬀective dose can be of value for comparing the relative doses from diﬀerentdiagnostic procedures and for comparing the use of similar technologies and proce-dures in diﬀerent hospitals and countries as well as the use of diﬀerent technologiesfor the same medical examination, provided that the reference patient or patientpopulations are similar with regard to age and sex.
(341) The assessment and interpretation of eﬀective dose from medical exposure of
patients is problematic when organs and tissues receive only partial exposure or a
very heterogeneous exposure, which is the case especially with diagnostic and inter-ventional procedures.
7.4. Exposure of patients who are pregnant
(342) Before any procedure using ionising radiation, it is important to determine
whether a female patient is pregnant. The feasibility and performance of medical
exposures during pregnancy require speciﬁc consideration owing to the radiation
sensitivity of the developing embryo/fetus.
(343) Prenatal doses from most correctly performed diagnostic procedures present
no measurably increased risk of prenatal or postnatal death, developmental damageincluding malformation, or impairment of mental development over the backgroundincidence of these entities. Life-time cancer risk following in-utero exposure isassumed to be similar to that following irradiation in early childhood. Higher dosessuch as those involved in therapeutic procedures have the potential to result in devel-
opmental harm (see Section 3.4).
(344) The pregnant patient has a right to know the magnitude and type of poten-
tial radiation eﬀects that might result from in-utero exposure. Almost always, if adiagnostic radiology examination is medically indicated, the risk to the mother ofnot doing the procedure is greater than the risk of potential harm to the embryo/fetus. However, some procedures and some radiopharmaceuticals that are used inICRP Publication 103
129nuclear medicine (e.g., radioiodides) can pose increased risks to the embryo/fetus.
The Commission has given detailed guidance in Publication 84 (ICRP, 2000a ).
(345) It is essential to ascertain whether a female patient is pregnant prior to radi-
ation therapy and some abdominal interventional procedures. In pregnant patients,cancers that are remote from the pelvis can usually be treated with radiation therapy.
This however requires particular attention in treatment planning. The expected radi-
ation dose to the embryo/fetus, including the scattering component, must be esti-mated. Cancers in the pelvis can rarely be adequately treated with radiationtherapy during pregnancy without severe or lethal consequences for the embryo/fetus.
(346) Termination of pregnancy owing to radiation exposure is an individual
decision aﬀected by many factors. Absorbed doses below 100 mGy to the embryo/fetus should not be considered a reason for terminating a pregnancy. At embry-
onic/fetal doses above this level, the pregnant patient should receive suﬃcient infor-
mation to be able to make informed decisions based upon individual circumstances,including the magnitude of the estimated embryonic/fetal dose and the consequentrisks of serious harm to the developing embryo/fetus and risks of cancer in later life.
(347) Radiation risks after prenatal radiation exposure are discussed in detail in
Publication 90 (ICRP, 2003a ). The exposure of patients who are pregnant is dealt
with in detail in Publication 84 (ICRP, 2000a ) and in Publication 105 (ICRP,
2007b ), which also discuss the considerations to be taken into account regarding ter-
mination of pregnancy after radiation exposure. Radiation exposure of pregnant fe-
males in biomedical research is discussed in Section 7.7.
7.5. Accident prevention in external beam therapy and brachytherapy
(348) Accident prevention in external beam therapy and brachytherapy should be
an integral part of the design of equipment and premises and of the working proce-dures. A key focus of accident prevention has long been the use of multiple defences
against the consequences of failures. This approach, called ‘defence in depth’, is
aimed at preventing equipment failures and human errors and mitigating their con-sequences, should they happen. The Commission has given extensive advice onreducing the probability of potential exposure and preventing accidents in Publica-
tions 76, 86, 97 and 98(ICRP, 1997b, 2000c, 2005b, 2005c ).
7.6. Protection of carers and comforters of patients treated with radionuclides
(349) Unsealed radionuclides are used in the diagnosis and treatment of various
diseases in the form of radiopharmaceuticals that are given to the patient by injec-tion, ingestion, or inhalation. These radiopharmaceuticals may localise in bodytissues until they decay or they may be eliminated through various pathways (e.g.,urine). Sealed sources are implanted in the patient’s body.
(350) Precautions for the public are rarely required after diagnostic nuclear med-
icine procedures but some therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures, particularlythose involving iodine–131, can result in signiﬁcant exposure to other people, espe-ICRP Publication 103
130cially those involved in the care and support of patients. Hence, members of the pub-
lic caring for such patients in hospital or at home require individual consideration.
(351) Publication 94 (ICRP, 2004b ) provides recommendations for the release of
patients after therapy with unsealed radionuclides. These recommendations includethat young children and infants, as well as visitors not engaged in direct care or com-
forting, should be treated as members of the public for radiological protection pur-
poses (i.e., be subject to the public dose limit of 1 mSv/year). For individuals directlyinvolved in comforting and caring, other than young children and infants, a doseconstraint of 5 mSv per episode (i.e., for the duration of a given release after therapy)is reasonable. The constraint needs to be used ﬂexibly. For example, higher dosesmay well be appropriate for parents of very sick children.
(352) The thyroid gland of persons under the age of 15 is more radiosensitive than
that of adults, so that particular care should be taken to avoid the contamination of
infants, children, and pregnant women from patients treated with radioiodine.
(353) The decision to hospitalise or release a patient after therapy should be
made on an individual basis considering several factors including residual activityin the patient, patient’s wishes, family consideration (particularly the presence ofchildren), environmental factors, and existing guidance and regulations. Publication
94(ICRP, 2004b ) comments on the use of holding tanks for the storage of urine,
implying that their use is unnecessary.
(354) The unintentional exposure of members of the public in waiting rooms and
on public transport usually is not high enough to require special restrictions on nu-
clear medicine patients, except for those being treated with radioiodine ( Publications
73and 94,ICRP, 1996a, 2004b ).
(355) In principle, similar reasoning applies when patients are treated with perma-
nently implanted sealed sources. However, the available data show that, in the vastmajority of cases, the dose to comforters and carers remains well below a value of1 mSv/year except for the rare case where the patient’s partner is pregnant at the timeof implantation and the anticipated dose to the pregnant partner could exceed 1 mSv
in a year ( Publication 98 ,ICRP, 2005c ).
(356) If the patient dies in the ﬁrst few months after implantation of a sealed
source, cremation of the corpse (frequent in some countries) raises several issuesrelated to: 1) the radioactive material that remains in the patient’s ashes; and2) the radioactive material that is released into the air, potentially inhaled by crema-torium staﬀ or members of the public. Available data shows that cremation can beallowed if 12 months have elapsed since implantation with iodine–125 (3 months forpalladium–103). If the patient dies before this delay has elapsed, speciﬁc measures
should be undertaken ( ICRP, 2005c ).
7.7. Volunteers for biomedical research
(357) Volunteers make a substantial contribution to biomedical research. Some of
the research studies are of direct value in the investigation of disease; others provideinformation on the metabolism of pharmaceuticals and of radionuclides that may beabsorbed from contamination of the workplace or the environment. Not all theseICRP Publication 103
131studies take place in medical institutions, but the Commission includes the exposure
of all volunteers in biomedical research under the category of medical exposure.
(358) The ethical and procedural aspects of the participation of volunteers in
biomedical research and its justiﬁcation have been addressed by the CommissioninPublication 62 (ICRP, 1991c ). That report also discusses dose constraints for
volunteers under diﬀerent conditions, as brieﬂy summarised in Table 8 (Chapter 6).
(359) In many countries, radiation exposure of pregnant females as subjects in bio-
medical research is not speciﬁcally prohibited. However, their involvement in suchresearch is very rare and should be discouraged unless pregnancy is an integral partof the research. For the protection of the embryo/fetus, strict controls should beplaced on the use of radiation in these cases.

1328. PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
(360) Interest in the protection of the environment has greatly increased in recent
years, in relation to all aspects of human activity. Such interest has been accompa-nied by the development and application of various means of assessing and manag-ing the many forms of human impact upon it. The Commission is thus aware of thegrowing need for advice and guidance on such matters in relation to radiologicalprotection even though such needs have not arisen from any new or speciﬁc concerns
about the eﬀects of radiation on the environment. The Commission also recognises
that there is a current lack of consistency at international level with respect toaddressing such issues in relation to radioactivity, and therefore believes that a moreproactive approach is now necessary.
8.1. The objectives of radiological protection of the environment
(361) The Commission acknowledges that, in contrast to human radiological pro-
tection, the objectives of environmental protection are both complex and diﬃcult to
articulate. The Commission does however subscribe to the global needs and eﬀortsrequired to maintain biological diversity, to ensure the conservation of species, andto protect the health and status of natural habitats, communities, and ecosystems.It also recognises that these objectives may be met in diﬀerent ways, that ionising radi-ation may be only a minor consideration – depending on the environmental exposuresituation – and that a sense of proportion is necessary in trying to achieve them.
(362) The Commission has previously concerned itself with mankind’s environ-
ment only with regard to the transfer of radionuclides through it, primarily in rela-
tion to planned exposure situations, because this directly aﬀects the radiologicalprotection of human beings. In such situations, it has been considered that the stan-dards of environmental control needed to protect the general public would ensurethat other species are not put at risk, and the Commission continues to believe thatthis is likely to be the case.
(363) However, the Commission considers that it is now necessary to provide
advice with regard to all exposure situations. It also believes that it is necessary to
consider a wider range of environmental situations, irrespective of any human con-
nection with them. The Commission is also aware of the needs of some nationalauthorities to demonstrate, directly and explicitly, that the environment is being pro-tected, even under planned situations.
(364) The Commission therefore believes that the development of a clearer frame-
work is required in order to assess the relationships between exposure and dose, andbetween dose and eﬀect, and the consequences of such eﬀects, for non-human spe-cies, on a common scientiﬁc basis. This issue was ﬁrst discussed in Publication 91
(ICRP, 2003b ), and it was concluded that it was necessary to draw upon the lessons
learned from the development of the systematic framework for the protection ofhuman beings. This framework is based on an enormous range of knowledge thatthe Commission attempts to convert into pragmatic advice that will be of value in
133managing diﬀerent exposure situations, bearing in mind the wide range of errors,
uncertainties, and knowledge gaps of the various databases.
(365) The advantage of such a comprehensive and systematic approach is that, as
the needs for change to any component of the system arise (as in the acquisition ofnew scientiﬁc data, or changes in societal attitudes, or simply from experience gained
in its practical application) it is then possible to consider what the consequences of
such a change may be elsewhere within the system, and upon the system as a whole.Such an approach would not work unless it was based on a numerical frameworkthat contained some key points of reference.
8.2. Reference Animals and Plants
(366) In the case of human radiological protection, the Commission’s approach to
such issues has been greatly assisted by the development of anatomical and physio-
logical reference models ( ICRP, 2002 ). It has concluded that a similar approach
would be of value as a basis for developing further advice and guidance for the pro-tection of other species. The Commission is therefore developing a small set of Ref-erence Animals and Plants ( Pentreath, 2005 ), plus their relevant databases, for a few
types of organisms that are typical of the major environments. Such entities willform the basis of a more structured approach to understanding the relationships be-tween exposures and dose, dose and eﬀects, and the potential consequences of such
eﬀects.
(367) The Reference Animals and Plants can be considered as hypothetical entities
with certain assumed basic biological characteristics of a particular type of animal orplant, as described to the generality of the taxonomic level of Family, with deﬁnedanatomical, physiological, and life-history properties. They are not, therefore, neces-sarily the direct objects of protection themselves but, by serving as points of refer-
ence, they should provide a basis upon which some management decisions couldbe made. Simple dosimetric models, plus relevant data sets, are currently being devel-
oped for diﬀerent stages of the life cycle of each type. Available data on radiation
eﬀects for each type are also being reviewed.
(368) Some form of practical means is obviously required in order to make judge-
ments, based on our current level of knowledge of the eﬀects of radiation on diﬀerenttypes of animals and plants, in order to meet the Commission’s objectives. With theexception of mammals, however, there is a general paucity of information uponwhich dose-response relationships can be established that would enable sensible con-clusions to be drawn, particularly with respect to the relatively low dose rates likely
to obtain in most exposure situations. Indeed, in general, the databases on radiation
eﬀects for the majority of animals and plants are not dissimilar to those relating to‘chemical toxicity’ studies, where the levels required to produce a given eﬀect aremany orders of magnitude greater than those expected in the majority of environ-mental situations.
(369) With radiation there is another source of reference, and that is the natu-
ral background radiation to which such animals and plants are continuously and‘typically’ exposed. Thus additional radiation doses to animals and plants can beICRP Publication 103
134compared with those dose rates known or expected to have certain biological eﬀects
in those types of animals and plants, and with the dose rates normally experienced bythem in their natural environments.
(370) The Commission does not therefore propose to set any form of ‘dose limits’
with respect to environmental protection. By setting out data for some Reference
Animals and Plants, in a transparently derived way, and upon which further action
may be considered, the Commission intends to oﬀer more practical advice than in thepast. The Commission will use this framework to gather and interpret data in orderto provide more comprehensive advice in the future, particularly with regard to thoseaspects or features of diﬀerent environments that are likely to be of concern underdiﬀerent radiation exposure situations.

140ICRP Publication 103Preface to Annex A
When the Commission initiated its project to review and update its 1990 Recom-
mendations, at the Main Commission meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1998,it was clear from the outset that the main text of the new Recommendations would
need to be supported by scientiﬁc Annexes and reports in much the same manner as
the 1990 Recommendations.
Therefore, ICRP Committees 1 (on radiation eﬀects) and 2 (on doses from radia-
tion exposure) were asked to outline and begin to draft Annexes on the health eﬀectsof radiation and on dosimetric considerations. (Committees 3 on protection in med-icine and 4 on the application of ICRP recommendations were similarly asked toproduce supporting documents which were and are being published as separate re-ports: Publication 105 , ICRP 2007b on protection in medicine and Publication 101 ,
ICRP 2006a, on assessing dose to the representative person and on optimisation).
After initial plenary work, Committee 1 formed a Task Group in 2001 to advise
the Main Commission and draft the present Annex to the Recommendations.
The membership of the Task Group was as follows:
R. Cox, Chairman J. Hendry A. Kellerer
C. Land C. Muirhead D. PrestonJ. Preston E. Ron K. SankaranarayananR. Shore R. Ullrich

141Principal conclusions and recommendations
The following summary statements relate largely to health eﬀects attributable to
radiation in the dose range up to around 100 mSv (as single or annual doses) for thepurposes of radiological protection.
/C15For the induction of cancer and heritable disease at low doses/low dose rates the use
of a simple proportionate relationship between increments of dose and increased risk
is a scientiﬁcally plausible assumption; uncertainties on this judgement arerecognised.
/C15A dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) of 2 recommended in Publication
60(ICRP, 1991b) should be retained for radiological protection purposes; the eﬀect
of introducing the possibility of a low-dose threshold for cancer risk is judged to be
equivalent to that of an uncertain increase in the value of DDREF.
/C15Proposed changes in radiation weighting factors for protons and neutrons are noted;these judgements are discussed in Annex B to the present Recommendations: ‘Quan-tities used in radiological protection’.
/C15New radiation detriment values and tissue weighting factors ( wT) have been pro-
posed; the most signiﬁcant changes from Publication 60 relate to breast, gonads,
and the treatment of remainder tissues. The wTchanges in question are: breast
(0.12 from 0.05); gonads (0.08 from 0.20); remainder tissues (0.12 from 0.05 usinga new additive system).
/C15Based upon cancer incidence data, detriment adjusted nominal risk coeﬃcients forcancer are 5.5 10
/C02Sv/C01for the whole population and 4.1 10/C02Sv/C01for adult
workers; the respective Publication 60 values are 6.0 10/C02Sv/C01and 4.8 10/C02Sv/C01.
/C15Detriment adjusted probability coeﬃcients for heritable disease up to the second gen-
eration are 0.2 10/C02Sv/C01for the whole population and 0.1 10/C02Sv/C01for adult work-
ers; the respective Publication 60 values are 1.3 10/C02Sv/C01and 0.8 10/C02Sv/C01but
these relate to risks at a theoretical equilibrium and no longer seem justiﬁed.
/C15Cancer risk following in-utero exposure is judged to be no greater than that follow-
ing exposure in early childhood.
/C15Knowledge of the roles of induced genomic instability, bystander cell signalling and
adaptive response in the genesis of radiation–induced health eﬀects is insuﬃcientlywell developed for radiological protection purposes; in many circumstances these cel-lular processes will be incorporated in epidemiological measures of risk.
/C15Genetic susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer involving strongly expressed genesis judged to be too rare to appreciably distort estimates of population risk; the poten-tial impact of common but weakly expressing genes remains uncertain.
/C15Dose responses for radiation-induced tissue reactions (deterministic eﬀects) in adultsand children are, in general, judged to have true dose thresholds which result in theabsence of risk at low doses; further consideration of the extent of the dose thresholdfor cataract induction (visual impairment) is recommended.
/C15Dose responses for in-utero radiation-induced tissue reactions, malformations andneurological eﬀects are also judged to show dose thresholds above around 100ICRP Publication 103
143mGy; uncertainty remains on the induction of IQ deﬁcits but at low doses the risk is
judged to be of no practical signiﬁcance.
/C15Risks of non-cancer disease at low doses remain most uncertain and no speciﬁcjudgement is possible.ICRP Publication 103
144A.1. Introduction
(A 1) Since the publication of the 1990 Recommendations of the ICRP ( Publica-
tion 60 , ICRP 1991b), ICRP Committee 1 has continued to maintain broad surveil-
lance on scientiﬁc developments regarding the quantiﬁcation of health eﬀects
attributable to radiation exposure and the biological mechanisms that underlie these
eﬀects. Much of the output of Committee 1 is represented in the reports of ICRPTask Groups, and Committee 1 Working Parties have reviewed data in other rele-vant areas.
(A 2) The purpose of the present Annex is to summarise all post–1990 Committee
1 judgements relating to the health eﬀects of radiation in order to support the devel-opment by the Commission of its new Recommendations. In many of the areas con-sidered in the present Annex, Committee 1 had already provided speciﬁc judgements,
e.g., on the risk of multifactorial diseases ( Publication 83 , ICRP 1999b), on radiation
weighting factors ( Publication 92 , ICRP 2003c) and on cancer risk at low doses
(Publication 99 , ICRP 2005d). However, the revision of a) judgements on the induc-
tion of tissue reactions; b) nominal risk coeﬃcients for risks of cancer and heritabledisease; c) the transport of cancer risk between diﬀerent populations; and d) thechoice of tissue weighting factors required much additional work. For this reasonthe above topics are covered in detail in this Annex.
(A 3) An additional feature of the present Annex is the extent to which the accu-
mulation of epidemiological and biological knowledge since 1990 has served to
strengthen some of the judgements made in Publication 60 or, in some cases, has
led to a revision in procedures for risk estimation. In spite of the detailed natureof these gains in knowledge, the principal objective of this Annex is the provisionof broad judgements for practical purposes of radiological protection. Accordingly,much of the work presented here centres on the continuing use of eﬀective dose as aradiological protection quantity for prospectively estimating risks in the populationand to demonstrate compliance with dose limits. The application of the concept of
eﬀective dose is discussed in Annex B.
(A 4) The Annex is structured in the following way. Section A.2 provides a brief
summary of the gains in knowledge since 1990 on the biological processes thatunderlie the health eﬀects of radiation exposure. Section A.3 provides updated judge-ments on the mechanisms and risks of radiation-induced tissue reactions. Section A.4considers the mechanisms and genetics of cancer induction, summarises previousjudgements on radiation weighting factors and details new epidemiologically basedjudgements on nominal risk coeﬃcients, transport of risk, radiation detriment and
tissue weighting factors; Section A.4 also summarises an earlier judgement on cancer
risk in utero. Section A.5 brieﬂy considers non-cancer diseases after radiation. InSection A.6, the Annex details a newly developed approach to the estimation ofrisks of heritable disease and provides a revised estimate of this risk. Finally, inSection A.7, a simple tabular format is used to summarise the principal recommen-dations of the Annex and to map these judgements to the appropriate sections of theAnnex.ICRP Publication 103

146A.2. Interactions of radiation with cells and tissues
(A 5) The purpose of this Section is to summarise knowledge on the interactions of
radiation with cells and tissues in the body with emphasis on the information andconcepts that have developed since 1990. The intention is to provide a biological
framework for the judgements to be developed in subsequent sections of the Annex.
Although some of these biological data and concepts are complex, much of this An-nex is intended for the non-specialist reader. Consequently the Annex will not enterinto the detail of many of the biological and biophysical debates but rather seeksclarity and simplicity on the judgements made. Details of these debates may be foundin earlier ICRP publications and other reviews.
A.2.1. Biophysical aspects of radiation action on cells
(A 6) ICRP has not speciﬁcally reviewed the broad topics of radiation biophysics
and microdosimetry since 1990 but important advances and judgements are given inPublication 92 (ICRP, 2003c) and in an ICRP Task Group report on Low-dose risks
(Publication 99 , ICRP, 2005d). The understanding of the early post-irradiation bio-
physical processes in cells and tissues has advanced substantially and the followingparagraphs brieﬂy highlight some major points of development. Further informationis available in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c), Publication 99 (ICRP, 2005d), Good-
head et al. (1996) and NAS/NRC (2006).
(A 7) Knowledge of the ﬁne structure of energy deposition from radiation tracks
in DNA dimensions has grown, largely through the further development of Monte-Carlo track structure codes. Coupled with radiobiological information, track struc-ture data have impacted greatly on thinking in respect of the nature of biologicallycritical damage to DNA.
(A 8) In particular, it has been recognised that a high proportion of radiation-
induced damage in DNA is represented in complex clusters of chemical alterations.
Such clustered damage can arise via a combination of damages induced by the main
tracks, secondary electrons and secondary reactive radical species. Double- andsingle-strand breaks (DSB and SSB) in the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone plusa variety of damaged DNA bases can combine together in clusters, with a substantialfraction of total damage being closely spaced. There is also evidence that both thefrequency and the complexity of complex clustered damage depends upon the linearenergy transfer (LET) of the radiation.
(A 9) When DSB, SSB and base damages are considered together, complex clustered
damage may constitute as much as 60% and 90% of total DNA damage after low and
high LET radiations respectively. These data highlight a major diﬀerence betweenDNA lesions induced by radiation and those arising spontaneously via oxidative attackby reactive chemical radicals. Whereas the former are predominantly complex andclustered, the latter are randomly distributed and simple in their chemical structure.
(A 10) As described in ICRP Publication 99 and noted in Section A.4.1, the diﬀer-
ent repair characteristics of simple and complex DNA lesions are an importantICRP Publication 103
147factor in the development of judgements on health eﬀects after low doses of
radiation.
(A 11) In addition to improvements in our understanding of the induction of com-
plex DNA damage by radiation there have been other advances in radiation bio-physics. For example, radiation-induced damage has been investigated at the level
of chromosome structure, and this work has been paralleled by the biophysical mod-
elling of the induction of gene/chromosomal mutations. There has also been valuabletechnical innovation including the development of single particle irradiation systems(microbeams) and of imaging methods for the cellular visualisation of DNA-proteininteractions during DNA damage response (see Publication 99, ICRP, 2005d; Cher-
ubini et al., 2002).
A.2.2. Chromosomal DNA as the principal target for radiation
(A 12) In addition to the biophysical information outlined in Section A.2.1, there
is more direct evidence that implicates chromosomal DNA as the principal cellulartarget for biological eﬀects. Much of the early evidence on this issue concerned thegreater radiobiological eﬀectiveness of radionuclides incorporated into DNA inthe cell nucleus as compared with cellular proteins in general (UNSCEAR 1993).More recently the use of microbeam irradiation facilities capable of delivering adeﬁned dose to diﬀerent parts of the cell has fully conﬁrmed the radiosensitivity of
the cell nucleus. However, as noted in Section A.2.5, these microbeam techniques
have also provided evidence of the potential complexity of cellular radiationresponse.
(A 13) In addition, since 1990 the critical importance of DNA damage for radio-
biological eﬀects, including cancer induction, has been emphasised by a large numberof studies with cells and animals that are genetically deﬁcient in DNA damage re-sponse – many of these speciﬁc genetic deﬁciencies increase the frequency of radio-biological eﬀects (UNSCEAR 1993, 2000; Publication 79 , ICRP 1998a; NAS/NRC
2006). Finally the rapidly developing concordance noted in Section A.2.1 between
biophysical predictions on radiation action, the biological importance of complexDNA damage and the characteristics of radiation-induced gene and chromosomalmutations add weight to the conclusion that certain forms of DNA damage are crit-ically important to radiobiological eﬀects.
A.2.3. DNA damage response and repair
DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular signalling
(A 14) Advances in knowledge of the mechanisms and consequences of post-irra-
diation processes in cells arguably represent the most profound change in our under-standing of radiobiology. Much of this advance can be ascribed to the greatlyimproved technology and knowledge base that is now characteristic of moderncell/molecular biology and genetics. The UNSCEAR 2000, NCRP 2001, NAS/NRC 2006 and ICRP 2005d ( Publication 99 ) reports deal with these issues in detail
and only a few key conclusions are given here.ICRP Publication 103
148/C15The isolation and characterisation of critical DNA damage response genes, e.g.,
for ATM, NBS and DNA PK csproteins, have provided insights into the structure
and function of the most important biochemical pathways that operate to recog-nise and signal the presence of DNA damage.
/C15There is now good understanding of many of these pathways and this leads to theview that error-prone repair of chemically complex DNA double-strand lesionsbest explains the cellular radiobiological responses known for many years, viz.,the induction of chromosome aberrations, gene mutation, and cell killing.
/C15The potential for error-free, recombinational repair of radiation-induced DNAdouble-strand lesions is recognised but, since it is thought to be restricted tothe later phases of the cell cycle, its impact on radiation risk overall is not likelyto be great.
/C15Coupled with earlier cellular studies, molecular and biochemical data add weight
to the view that the activity of DNA damage response and repair processes are
major determinants of dose/dose rate and radiation quality eﬀects in cells.
/C15Post-irradiation programmed cell death (apoptosis) and delaying eﬀects on thepassage of cells through their reproductive cycles are now much better understoodat the molecular and biochemical levels.
/C15In terms of protective eﬀects, apoptotic elimination of radiation damaged cellsmay be viewed as an alternative to repair, i.e., apoptotic death reduces the fre-quency of viable cells carrying mutations.
/C15The imposition of cell cycle checkpoints in irradiated cells has been biochemicallylinked with the complex network of DNA damage signalling and may serve tomaximise opportunities for repair or as points where the cell decides its fate (lifeor death) on the basis of biochemical balance. The evidence for this is, however,limited.
/C15New highly sensitive techniques for studying the induction of DNA double-strandbreaks in single cells and post-irradiated cellular signalling show great promise forgaining knowledge of DNA damage response at low doses.
(A 15) A critical element in the advances that underpin the above judgements is
the now compelling evidence that perturbation of DNA damage response/repairand apoptotic/cell cycle control are often closely associated with tumorigenic devel-opment. This concept gives increased conﬁdence that these cellular activities are inte-gral to the cellular defences mounted against post-irradiation tumour development.This in turn means that the characteristics of these cellular processes are importantelements in the development of judgements in radiological protection.
Adaptive responses
(A 16) The relatively high level of knowledge gained on post-irradiation DNA re-
pair, apoptosis and cellular signalling may be contrasted with the continuing uncer-tainty on the mechanisms and signiﬁcance of so-called adaptive responses. Typically,in some experimental systems, adaptive responses are seen in cells conditioned by apriming dose of radiation. In some way this conditioning dose allows cells to developincreased resistance to a second radiation challenge.ICRP Publication 103
149(A 17) Data relating to adaptive responses of various types have been reviewed
extensively (UNSCEAR 1994, 2000, NCRP 2001, NAS/NRC 2006, ICRP 2005d).The principal conclusions from these reviews may be summarised as follows:
/C15Adaptive responses are not a universal feature of cells in vitro or in vivo.
/C15Even in the most well-studied cellular system (cytogenetic response in human lym-
phocytes) there is a) no evidence that adaptive responses may be triggered by
doses of a few tens of milligray and b) there is considerable donor variation inthe expression of the response.
/C15Although some studies support an association with more general stress responsemechanisms, chemical radical scavenging and/or more eﬃcient DNA repair,
mechanistic knowledge of adaptive responses remains fragmentary.
/C15Although there are some positive results, animal studies on tumour induction
(and immune response) do not provide consistent evidence of adaptive responsesthat reduce adverse health eﬀects.
A.2.4. The induction of gene and chromosomal mutations
(A 18) As noted earlier there are now strong links between the biophysical pro-
cesses that determine the induction of complex DNA double-strand lesions, error-
prone DNA damage response/repair processes and the forms of gene and chromo-
somal mutations (DNA sequence loss or rearrangement) characteristic of ionisingradiation exposure. Much of the available quantitative dose-response data for cellspre-date Publication 60 , and the speciﬁc forms of mutational dose response recorded
depend upon the biological system, the mutational endpoint, the radiation quality(LET) and the dose rate (Thacker et al., 1992, UNSCEAR, 1993, 2000).
(A 19) In general, however, mutational dose-responses are linear-quadratic for low
LET, and tend towards linearity as LET increases. For low LET radiations, reduc-
tion in dose rate usually reduces the frequency of induced gene/chromosomal muta-
tions in mammalian somatic and germ cells. The maximum dose-rate reductionfactor is usually 3–4 but it can be somewhat higher for chromosome aberrationinduction in human lymphocytes. A reasonably consistent relationship betweenRBE and LET for mutation induction has also been recorded with maximum valuesfor RBE of around 10–20 usually being seen in the LET range 70–200 keV lm
/C01.
(A 20) A novel feature of recent studies involving ‘chromosome painting’ tech-
niques is that complex chromosome exchanges involving the interaction of more
than two breakpoints are infrequent at low doses of low LET radiation but can
be a signiﬁcant fraction of high LET induced events at all doses. Advances inthe understanding of radiation action on cellular DNA has included modellingof the formation of chromosomal exchanges but contention remains as to whetherthese exchanges demand the interaction of two damaged sites or whether a signif-icant fraction derives from the interaction of damaged and undamaged sites(UNSCEAR 2000). Since 1990 considerable eﬀort has been made to investigatethe induction of gene and chromosomal mutations at low doses. There are manyICRP Publication 103
150technical factors that limit the resolution of such low-dose eﬀects but two studies
are notable.
(A 21) First, a large-scale investigation of chromosome aberration induction by
x rays in human lymphocytes provided evidence of a linear dose-response at lowdoses with a limit of resolution of around 20 mGy. Second, the use of a highly sen-
sitive in-vivo mutation system relating to pigment-producing cells in mouse skin
showed linearity of mutational dose response down to the lowest x-ray doses ofaround 50 mGy (see UNSCEAR 2000, ICRP 2005d).
(A 22) There have also been valuable developments in the use of chromosomal
aberration not only as a biomarker of radiation exposure but also for the purposesof establishing relationships between in-vivo cellular response, dose/dose-rate eﬀectsand potential health outcomes (Tucker et al., 1997, Tawn et al., 2004).
A.2.5. Epigenetic responses to radiation
(A 23) A major feature of radiobiological research since 1990 has been a range of
studies that provide evidence of post-irradiation cellular responses that appear toresult in genomic change and/or cellular eﬀect without an obvious requirement fordirectly induced DNA damage (see Cherubini et al. 2002, NAS/NRC 2006, ICRP2005d). In a broad sense these processes may be termed epigenetic and they contrastwith the well-established radiobiological concept of direct DNA targeting by ionising
radiation tracks which has underpinned much of the post-1990 developments in bio-
physics and DNA damage response. Although there are elements of overlap, theseepigenetic eﬀects may be placed in two categories: a) radiation-induced genomicinstability; b) post-irradiation bystander signalling between cells.
Radiation-induced genomic instability
(A 24) Whereas conventional DNA damage response is known to result in the
expression of genomic damage within the ﬁrst or second post-irradiation cell cycles,
the term ‘induced genomic instability’ broadly describes a set of phenomena whereby
genomic damage and its cellular consequences are expressed persistently over manypost-irradiation cell cycles (Little 2003, Morgan 2003). This instability, as expressedin cultured cells, can take the form of increased frequencies of chromosome aberra-tions, gene mutations and apoptosis/cell death; other manifestations have also beenrecorded. Publication 99 (ICRP 2005d) and the NAS/NRC (2006) report have re-
viewed the recent evidence concerning induced genomic instability including theexamples noted below.
(A 25) Much of the in-vitro cellular work on induced genomic instability has been
performed using chromosomal endpoints. Although persistent chromosomal insta-bility has been reproducibly demonstrated in mass cultures of established cell lines,there have been fewer studies of clonal cell populations and normal diploid cells. Inthis context a recent cytogenetic study with human diploid ﬁbroblasts using massculture and clonal techniques was particularly revealing in that it found no evidenceof instability phenomena.ICRP Publication 103
151(A 26) This negative result raises the possibility that induced genomic instability is
preferentially expressed in abnormal or genetically altered cells, and this would beconsistent with the diﬃculties experienced in clearly demonstrating the phenomenonin vivo. After in-vivo exposure of humans and mice to high and low LET radiations,cytogenetic results have been negative or showed inconsistent evidence of persistent
instability in haemopoietic cells. Nevertheless there are some positive results in cer-
tain mouse strains and normal cells, and further work is called for. In addition, thereare indications that, in mice, the expression of induced genomic instability varieswith genetic background and, in some cases, it may associate with deﬁciency inDNA damage response.
(A 27) The biological basis for induced genomic instability in its various forms is
not well understood. Some biochemical data suggest the involvement of cellularstress and oxidative processes; other cytogenetic studies implicate potentially unsta-
ble DNA segments encoding DNA repeat sequences.
Post-irradiation bystander signalling
(A 28) The so-called bystander eﬀect relates to the expression of cell death/apop-
tosis, gene/chromosomal mutation, genomic instability and/or changing patterns ofprotein abundance in cells not directly intersected by radiation tracks (see Little,2003, Morgan, 2003, Mothersill and Seymour, 2001). These bystander cells are be-lieved to be responding to signals from their irradiated neighbours via intercellular
communication mediated by molecules passing through gap junctions in adjoining
cell membranes or via diﬀusion of these signalling molecules through the cell culturemedium. Data relating to the bystander eﬀects of radiation are reviewed in Publica-
tion 99 (ICRP, 2005d) and the NAS/NRC (2006) report and only a few points are
noted here.
(A 29) Experimental studies on the bystander eﬀect in cultured cells have been
greatly facilitated by the development of microbeam irradiation facilities which allowthe delivery of deﬁned numbers of radiation tracks to cells or their nuclei. In this
way, cellular eﬀects arising in unirradiated cells may be speciﬁcally determined.
Alternatively cells may be irradiated in mass culture with a ﬂuence of particles thatallows for only a fraction of cells/cell nuclei to be intersected. The expression of by-stander signalling is then evidenced by a frequency of cellular eﬀects that exceeds thenumber of track intersections.
(A 30) The majority of bystander studies relate to cellular irradiation with high
LET alpha particles and protons although some low LET studies, particularly onsignalling through the growth medium, are available. The biological mechanisms in-
volved in bystander signalling are probably diverse and remain to be adequately elu-
cidated. Some data point towards induction of oxidative stress and modulation ofDNA damage-response pathways. In the case of eﬀects mediated through the culturemedium, there is some evidence for the release of chromosome-damaging (clasto-genic) factors from irradiated cells and the mobilisation of intracellular calcium to-gether with increased reactive oxygen species in recipient cells.ICRP Publication 103
152(A 31) Thus, the phenomena of induced genomic instability and bystander eﬀects
when expressed in vitro may show some common stress-related mechanisms. Thereare, however, few data and some controversies on the relative contribution ofbystander signalling to cellular eﬀects overall and the extent to which this is dose-dependent. Studies on bystander eﬀects in vivo are in their infancy although there
are some positive data relating to clastogenic factors.
A.2.6. Tissue reactions (deterministic eﬀects)
(A 32) There have been no profound changes in scientiﬁc views on the quantitative
aspects of harmful radiation-induced tissue reactions (deterministic eﬀects) since1990. However, there have been some developments concerning the mechanismsthrough which these reactions may be modiﬁed (see also Section A.3).
(A 33) An increasing number of studies on early tissue reactions have shown the
ability to modify these using various cytokines and growth factors, primarily to stim-ulate regeneration of progenitor cells. Other biological response modiﬁers can beused for late reactions, in particular vascular modifying agents that delay the expres-sion of organ damage induced in experimental animal systems. This ability to modifythe response of tissues and organs means that the term ‘deterministic eﬀects’ is notentirely accurate because, quantitatively, the eﬀects are not necessarily pre-deter-mined. Nevertheless, this term has become widely and ﬁrmly established, and the
Commission continues to use the expression ‘deterministic eﬀects’ to denote tissue
and organ reactions.
(A 34) It has been recognised more since the 1990 Recommendations that the
structure of tissues and organs plays a major role in their response to irradiation.Paired organs, or organs where the functional subunits (FSU) are arranged in par-allel, rather than in series, can sustain inactivation of many FSU without clinicalsigns of injury, because of a substantial reserve capacity and compensation by theremainder of the FSU. This is one of the major reasons for the presence of a thresh-
old dose for overt injury, and in particular for a high tolerance to partial-body irra-
diation, where a critical part of such organs may be spared.
(A 35) Late tissue reactions not only have a long and dose-dependent latency per-
iod before expression, but also they have a long progression period, with the inci-dence in many cases still rising well past 10 years after irradiation. Late reactionscan be ‘generic’, which means that they arise directly in the responsible target tissue.Alternatively, late reactions can be ‘consequential’, meaning that they arise as a laterconsequence of a severe early reaction aﬀecting the target tissue.
(A 36) There has been a consolidation of the use of the linear-quadratic formal-
ism for describing the changes in iso-eﬀective dose resulting from changes in thepattern of dose delivery, i.e., acute single doses, multifractionated doses, or contin-uous exposures. In general, the ratio of the linear and quadratic constants is higherfor early reactions and consequential late reactions, and lower for generic latereactions.ICRP Publication 103
153A.2.7. Mechanisms of radiation tumorigenesis
(A 37) The technical and academic developments in biology since 1990 have also
had a major impact on our understanding of the complex process of multistagetumorigenic development (e.g., UNSCEAR 1993, 2000, NCRP 2001, NAS/NRC
2006, ICRP 2005d). In simple terms the complex multistage process may be subdi-
vided in the following way: a) Tumour initiation – the entry of a normal cell intoan aberrant cellular pathway (pre-neoplastic state) that can lead to cancer; b) Tu-mour promotion – enhancement of the growth and development of a pre-neoplasticclone of initiated cells; c) Malignant conversion – the change from a pre-neoplasticstate to one where cancer development is likely; and d) Tumour progression – thelater phases of tumorigenesis where cells gain properties that allow more rapid devel-opment and the acquisition of invasive characteristics.
(A 38) In brief both lympho-haemopoietic and solid tumours are believed to orig-
inate from single stem-like cells in their respective tissues. Certain gene and chromo-somal mutations, which are often tissue-speciﬁc, can confer cellular properties whichallow these target stem cells to partially escape from their normal constraints ofgrowth and development. In some cases these cells acquire novel properties via gainof function mutations in so-called oncogenes; in others, it is loss of function ofso-called tumour-suppressor genes that applies. On current hypotheses, the fullpotential for malignancy in these tumour-initiated cell clones is then developed in
a step-wise fashion via the appearance of other gene/chromosomal mutations or in
some cases the non-mutational silencing of key genes. In this way, over time,tumours develop increasing malignant potential by growth selection and the bypassof cell senescence. In some cases the rate of tumour development may be increasedfollowing the acquisition of mutations that result in the de-stabilisation of DNA andchromosomes. This process of accelerated mutation rate can be a major drive fortumorigenesis in many tissues but, given its clear mutational basis, tumour-associ-ated genomic instability is distinct from the phenomenon of radiation-induced geno-
mic instability noted in Section A.2.5.
(A 39) Tumour development is, however, far more complex than the stepwise
accumulation of clonal mutations. There is good evidence that the micro environ-mental interaction of tumorigenic and normal cells is a critical element in cancerdevelopment, and the recruitment of a blood supply to an evolving solid tumouris one important example of this.
(A 40) Since 1990 there has been good progress in understanding the mechanistic
basis of radiation tumorigenesis using animal models and by undertaking genetic
analysis of certain radiation-associated human tumours (see UNSCEAR 1993,
2000, NCRP 2001, NAS/NRC 2006, ICRP 2005d).
Animal models of radiation tumorigenesis
(A 41) A combination of cellular, cytogenetic, molecular and histopathological
techniques has been employed to investigate experimentally multistage radiationtumorigenesis. Much of the most informative work has been undertaken in rodentmodels with some of these models having a genetic basis which has been informedICRP Publication 103
154by studies with human counterpart tumours. In brief, for leukaemia and solid tu-
mours of the skin, bone, brain, lung, breast and gastro-intestinal tract there is evi-dence on the process of multistage tumorigenesis after radiation and the identityof some of the critical mutations involved. Many of these mutations are present inthe human counterpart tumours and also in the same rodent tumours arising spon-
taneously or after exposure to other carcinogens. Overall a key message from these
studies is that radiation tumorigenesis appears to proceed in an unremarkable mul-tistage manner with no obvious features that distinguish radiation as an unusual car-cinogen. In particular, although data remain sparse, there are as yet no indicationsthat the epigenetic process of induced genomic instability makes a consistent andmajor contribution to radiation tumorigenesis.
(A 42) Animal models have also been used to investigate the point of action of
radiation in multistage tumour development (UNSCEAR, 1993, 2000, NCRP,
2001, ICRP, 2005d, NAS/NRC, 2006). These data provide evidence that radiation
is only a weak promoter of tumour development and a role in the earliest (initiation)phase of tumorigenesis seems more likely. More direct evidence of such initiationproperties has been obtained in a recent study of post-irradiation intestinal tumori-genesis in Apc-deﬁcient mice (Ellender et al., 2005). This study showed that the prin-
cipal eﬀect of radiation was to increase the number of microscopic pre-neoplasticintestinal lesions rather than to enhance tumour development, and also that directsingle-gene mutational events could account for radiation-induced intestinal ade-
noma yields. Molecular and cytogenetic studies using animal models add further
weight to the argument that radiation acts early in the tumorigenic process via agene-loss mechanism.
(A 43) In principle, its mutagenic properties should allow radiation to contribute
throughout multistage tumorigenesis. However, the very high spontaneous rate ofgenome instability and damage that frequently characterises the post-initiationphases would tend to make these later phases less dependent on radiation-inducedmutations (UNSCEAR 2000).
(A 44) Data from quantitative animal studies on radiation tumorigenesis are
important for the development of some critical judgements in radiological protec-tion. The implications of such data in respect of the eﬀects of dose, dose-rate andradiation quality are noted later in this Annex.
Radiation-associated human tumours
(A 45) There are limited opportunities for mechanistic investigations with human
tumours which have a high probability of radiation causation. The cytogenetic and
molecular studies undertaken with radiation-associated tumours of lung, liver, thy-
roid, skin and bone marrow have tended to focus on particular gene or chromosomalmutations, and the relationship between these mutations and initial radiation dam-age remains unclear (UNSCEAR, 2000). However, in general accord with the resultsof animal studies, the human data developed since 1990 do not suggest that radiationtumorigenesis proceeds in an unusual fashion; evidence for the presence of speciﬁcmutational signatures of radiation is currently lacking. The involvement of inducedICRP Publication 103
155genomic instability in radiation tumorigenesis has been found to be lacking or is
viewed as controversial (Nakanishi et al., 2001, Cox and Edwards, 2002, Lohreret al., 2001).
Genetic susceptibility to cancer
(A 46) The issue of inter-individual genetic diﬀerences in susceptibility to radia-
tion-induced cancer was noted in Publication 60 and reviewed in Publication 79
(ICRP 1998a), UNSCEAR (2000, 2001) and the BEIR VII report (NAS/NRC2006). Since 1990 there has been a remarkable expansion in knowledge of the varioussingle-gene human genetic disorders where excess spontaneous cancer is expressed ina high proportion of gene carriers – the so-called high penetrance genes. There is alsoa growing recognition and some data on variant genes of lower penetrance wheregene–gene and gene–environment interactions determine a far more variable expres-
sion of cancer.
(A 47) Studies with cultured human cells and genetically altered laboratory ro-
dents have also contributed much to knowledge and, with more limited epidemiolog-ical/clinical data, suggest that a high proportion of single-gene, cancer-pronedisorders will show increased sensitivity to the tumorigenic eﬀects of radiation.
(A 48) Recently, good progress has been made in demonstrating experimentally
the complex interactions that may underlie the expression of cancer-predisposinggenes of lower penetrance (NAS/NRC 2006); this work is however in its infancy.
A.2.8. Heritable diseases
(A 49) Views on the risks of induction of heritable diseases by radiation exposure
of the gonads were developed in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) by extrapolating
quantitative data on dose response for germ cell mutations in experimental animals(predominantly mice) to humans. Although extended follow-ups of mortality andcancer incidence in the oﬀspring of the Japanese A-bomb survivors have been pub-
lished (Izumi et al., 2003a, 2003b) these data do not alter the conclusions of previous
analyses. In addition, few new quantitative data on mutation induction in mice havebecome available. However, since 1990 there have been signiﬁcant developments inour understanding of the mutational process and new concepts for genetic riskestimation in human populations (UNSCEAR 2001, NAS/NRC, 2006). Althoughit remains the case that no human studies provide direct evidence of a radiation-associated excess of heritable disease, the data from experimental animals providea compelling reason for ICRP to continue to make best use of advances in genetics
in order to improve its estimate of these risks.
(A 50) The application of molecular genetic techniques has provided detailed
knowledge of the molecular basis of naturally occurring mutations that cause heri-table diseases in humans; also of radiation-induced gene (speciﬁc locus) mutationsin mouse germ cells. There is now strong evidence that large multilocus deletionsof the genome constitute the predominant class of radiation-induced mutation. Itis judged that only a proportion of such multigene loss events will be compatible withICRP Publication 103
156embryonic/fetal developmental and live birth. These ﬁndings have led to the concept
that the principal adverse genetic eﬀect in humans is likely to take the form of mul-tisystem developmental abnormalities rather than single gene diseases.
(A 51) Another conceptual change based upon new human genetic information is
the development of methods to assess the responsiveness of the frequency of chronic
multifactorial diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease and diabetes) to an increase in
mutation rate. This has allowed an improved estimate to be made of the risks asso-ciated with this large and complex class of disease where expression requires theinteraction of genetic and environmental factors.
(A 52) These human genetic, experimental and conceptual advances have been
integrated to form a new and more robust framework for the estimation of geneticrisks (UNSCEAR 2001).
(A 53) There have also been developments on the estimation of radiation-induced
mutation rates in mice and humans using expanded simple tandem DNA repeat
(ESTR) loci in mice and minisatellite loci in humans. These DNA repeats are highlymutable with the mutations manifesting as changes in the number of tandem repeats.This increased mutability is expressed spontaneously and after radiation, and atten-tion has been given to the mutational mechanisms involved, including the untargetedand transgenerational eﬀects of radiation (UNSCEAR, 2000, 2001, CERRIE, 2004).However, since on current knowledge mutations at these DNA repeat sequences areonly rarely associated with genetic disorders, the Commission judges that there is no
good reason to include quantitative mutational data for these loci in the estimates of
genetic risk given in Section A.6 of this report.

A.3.1. Revision of judgements given in ICRP Publication 60
Deﬁnition of stochastic eﬀects and tissue reactions
(A 54) The deposition of energy by ionising radiation is a random process. Even at
very low doses it is possible that suﬃcient energy may be deposited into a critical vol-ume within a cell to result in cellular changes or cell death. The killing of one or asmall number of cells will, in most cases, have no consequences in tissues, but mod-iﬁcations in single cells, such as genetic changes or transformations leading ulti-mately to malignancy, may have serious consequences. These eﬀects resulting fromdamage in a single cell are termed stochastic eﬀects. There is a ﬁnite probability ofthe occurrence of such stochastic events even at very low doses, so there will be
no threshold dose unless all such events can be repaired up to some level of dose.
As the dose is increased the frequency of such events increases, but in the absenceof other modifying factors, the severity of the resultant eﬀects is not expected to in-crease, in contrast to the case for tissue reactions (see below).
(A 55) With larger doses there may be a substantial amount of cell killing, suﬃ-
cient to result in detectable tissue reactions. These reactions may occur early or lateafter irradiation. The depletion of renewing parenchymal cell populations, modiﬁedby stromal inﬂuences, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of early tissue reac-
tions. In order to reach the level of detection, a given proportion of cells must be de-
pleted. This constitutes a threshold, which depends on the speciﬁed level of injury.These reactions are distinct from the stochastic eﬀects in single cells, which are theinduction of cancers from irradiated somatic cells and genetic diseases in oﬀspringfollowing parental germ cell irradiation.
(A 56) When the term stochastic was introduced regarding single-cell eﬀects, ef-
fects caused by injury in populations of cells were called non-stochastic ( Publication
41, ICRP 1984). This was later considered an unsuitable term, and in Publication 60
(ICRP 1991b) it was replaced by the term deterministic, meaning ‘causally deter-
mined by preceding events’. Now it is recognised that both early and late tissue reac-tions are not necessarily predetermined, and they can be modiﬁed after irradiation bythe use of various biological response modiﬁers. Hence it is considered more accurateto refer to these eﬀects as early or late tissue or organ reactions. However, the Com-mission recognises that the generic terms, deterministic and stochastic eﬀects, have aﬁrmly embedded use in its system of protection and will use the generic and directlydescriptive terms synonymously, according to context.
Tissue and organ reactions
(A 57) Early tissue reactions (on a timescale of hours to a few weeks) can be
inﬂammatory-type reactions as a result of cell permeability changes and histaminerelease, e.g., erythema, and subsequent reactions as a consequence of cell loss,e.g., mucositis, and desquamatory reactions in epithelial tissues.
(A 58) Late tissue reactions (on a timescale of months to years) are called ‘generic’
if they occur as a result of injury directly in the target tissue, e.g., vascular occlusionsICRP Publication 103
159leading to deep tissue necrosis after protracted irradiations, or ‘consequential’ if they
occur as a result of early reactions, e.g., dermal necrosis as a result of severe epider-mal denudation and chronic infection, and intestinal strictures caused by severemucosal ulceration (Do ¨rr and Hendry 2001).
Cell survival curves
(A 59) Cell depletion plays a major role in the early desquamatory reactions in epi-
thelial tissues after irradiation. In a few cell types and tissues, rapid cell loss afterirradiation is mediated by apoptosis, as exempliﬁed by lymphocytes and salivaryglands. In other tissues, cell death is caused by reproductive failure of regenerativestem cells, which may undergo apoptosis before or after attempted mitoses, or ofproliferating transit (diﬀerentiating) cells. The majority of non-proliferating maturecells do not die from irradiation, but from natural senescence. For a given level of
tissue damage, it has been shown that dose modifying factors for diﬀerent irradiation
conditions are the same for survival of tissue target cells and for a given level of earlytissue reactions, demonstrating the importance of target cell survival for these typesof reaction (Hendry and Thames 1987).
(A 60) The survival of cells as a function of dose (Fig. A.3.1) is commonly de-
scribed using the linear-quadratic equation:
S¼exp/C0ðaDþbD
2Þ
Fig. A.3.1. Dose response for cell survival (S) on a semi-log plot described by the linear-quadratic
equation S = exp /C0(aD+bD2). From ICRP (1991b).ICRP Publication 103
160(A 61) The constant adescribes the linear component of cell sensitivity to killing on a
semi-log plot of survival (log) versus dose (linear), and bdescribes the increasing sen-
sitivity of cells to higher radiation doses. The ratio a/bis the dose at which the linear
and quadratic components of cell killing are equal. This ratio is a measure of the cur-vature of the survival curve. The a/bratio is lower and the curve on a semi-log plot is
more pronounced for homogeneous, slowly proliferating cell populations, such as in
slow-renewing organ systems such as kidney and spinal cord. The a/bratio is higher
and the survival curve is straighter for heterogeneous, rapidly proliferating cellpopulations, such as the regenerative target cell populations in oral mucosa andintestine. One possible contributor to this straightening is the presence ofsub-populations with diﬀerent sensitivities as a function of cell-cycle phase. Thea/bratio is generally in the range 7–20 Gy for early reactions in tissues (10 Gy is
commonly used) and 0.5–6 Gy for late reactions (3 Gy is commonly used).
(A 62) When dose rates are lower than around 0.1 Gy/hour there is repair of cel-
lular radiation injury during the irradiation. This causes the bcomponent to decrease
and to reach zero at very low dose rates. The acomponent is not modiﬁable by
changing dose rate. A special feature for some cell types is hypersensitivity to dosesless than 0.5 Gy, typically at 0.2–0.3 Gy (Joiner et al. 2001), but not at higher doses.This causes a deviation from the smooth linear-quadratic cell survival curve. It isconsidered by some to be due to stimulation of repair processes at doses above0.2–0.3 Gy. The deviation has been detected for early skin reactions in humans,
and for skin reactions and kidney injury in experimental animal systems. The rele-
vance of this hypersensitivity phenomenon for tissue injury thresholds is not yetclear.
(A 63) With high LET irradiations, there is less repairable injury and hence the b
component and dose rate eﬀects are small or absent. There is also no hypersensitivitycomponent to the survival curve.
Early and late reactions in tissues and organs
(A 64) Early desquamatory reactions in epithelia, and depression of the haemopoi-
etic system, are caused by the sterilisation of stem and progenitor cells in the tissues,resulting in a transitory or permanent lack of mature cells depending on the level ofdose. Such reactions are characteristic of the radiation response of renewing cell lin-eages, such as those of the epidermis, mucosa, haemopoiesis and spermatogenesis.The time course of expression and restoration of tissue components generally de-pends on their normal rate of renewal, and is dose dependent at low doses but notat high doses. Complete denudation of such tissues after high doses occurs at a time
equivalent to the lifetime of new mature cells plus those produced by any radioresis-
tant progenitor cells. The stroma produces a variety of growth factors that inducethe repopulation and diﬀerentiation needed to restore particular tissue components.The time course can be advanced and the restoration made more complete by theapplication of exogenous growth factors that further stimulate the reparativeprocesses.
(A 65) Late reactions in tissues are due in part to the slow rate of renewal and
death of component cell populations, where the cells are functional as well as capableICRP Publication 103
161of division (Michalowski 1981, Wheldon et al. 1982). Late reactions are also due to
dysfunction of a complex system of inter-cellular signalling pathways which nor-mally regulate the various tissue and organ functions (Rubin et al. 1998). In sometissues it has been shown that diﬀerent types of damage appear after diﬀerent latencyperiods. For example, in spinal cord, there is an early demyelination eﬀect within a
few months, then a second phase of demyelination and necrosis of the white matter
after 6–18 months, and a later phase after 1–4 years that is mostly a vasculopathy(van der Kogel 2002).
(A 66) In most tissues, responses are greater when irradiated volumes are larger.
With early skin reactions, the volume eﬀect is due largely to the decreasing abilityto heal large areas mainly because of limited cell migration from the margins. Withlate reactions the volume eﬀect relates to organ architecture. In spinal cord the crit-ical elements are arranged in series, so that when more elements are irradiated, there
is a greater chance of inactivating one of them to cause paralysis. There is also less
beneﬁt from cellular migration from the edges of the radiation ﬁeld when irradiatedvolumes are larger. By contrast, in for example kidney and lung, the tissue functionalsubunits (FSU, respectively nephrons and alveoli) are arranged in parallel (Witherset al. 1988). In these cases, there can be inactivation of some FSU without causing adecrease in organ function, until a critical number of FSU is reached. Late tissue in-jury is progressive and strongly dose dependent, and it has been shown that the inci-dence of late morbidity after radiotherapy in humans continues to increase gradually
to 10 years and beyond (Jung et al. 2001). There are various procedures that have
been shown in experimental animal systems to delay the onset and development oflate radiation morbidity (see below).
(A 67) Tissues vary not only in their temporal responsiveness, but also in their
radiosensitivity. Among the most radiosensitive tissues are the ovary and testes, bonemarrow, and the lens of the eye. In general, the dose-incidence relationship for thesetissues will be sigmoid in shape when plotted on linear axes, the eﬀect becoming morefrequent as the dose increases (Fig. A.3.2a). Tissue and organ reactions vary with the
dose, in severity as well as in incidence. The upper panel in Fig. A.3.3 illustrates how
the incidence of a particular reaction, deﬁned as a clinically recognisable patholog-ical condition, increases as a function of dose in a population of individuals of
Fig. A.3.2. Relationship between mortality and dose: (a) sigmoid relationship on a linear–linear plot,
(b) linear relationship on a transformed-probability–linear plot. From ICRP (1991b).ICRP Publication 103
162varying sensitivities. The lower panel in Fig. A.3.3 represents the dose-severity rela-
tionship for a population of individuals with various sensitivities. The severity of thepathological condition increases most markedly in those individuals in a subgroupwho are most sensitive (curve a), reaching the threshold of detectability at a lowerdose than in the less sensitive groups (curves b and c). The range of dose over whichthe diﬀerent subgroups cross the same threshold of severity is reﬂected in the upperpanel of Fig. A.3.3, which shows the frequency of the pathological condition in thetotal population, and which reaches 100% only at that dose which is suﬃcient to ex-
ceed the deﬁned threshold of severity in all members of the population.
(A 68) In reality, substantially less than 1% of a general population is very radio-
sensitive because of inherited mutations in important DNA damage-sensing or repairgenes. The remainder has a spectrum of sensitivities, and this has a ﬂattening inﬂu-ence on the slope of the dose-incidence curve. This modiﬁcation of the slope is inaddition to primary contributions from inherent target-cell sensitivity and from fea-tures of tissue architecture discussed above. It is not yet possible to determine accu-rately the sensitivity of individuals within this spectrum of radiosensitivities, using
cellular or molecular tests.
(A 69) Threshold doses for some tissue and organ reactions in the more radiosen-
sitive tissues in the body are shown in Table A.3.1. These have been deduced fromvarious radiotherapeutic experiences and accidental exposure incidents. In general,fractionated doses or protracted doses at low dose rate are less damaging than areacute doses.

eﬀects). Upper panel: expected sigmoidal increase in frequency in a population of individuals with varying
sensitivities. Lower panel: expected dose-severity relationships for three individuals with diﬀerentsensitivities. From ICRP (1991b).ICRP Publication 103
163Mortality after whole body exposure
(A 70) Mortality after irradiation is generally the result of severe cell depletion in
tissues of, or other major dysfunction of, one or more vital organs of the body. Afterpartial body irradiation, or inhomogeneous whole body irradiation, the probability
of death of an individual will depend on the particular organs exposed, the volume
irradiated, and the dosage level. After whole body irradiation which is fairly homo-geneous, for example with penetrating photon beams above about 1 MeV energy,death may occur from one of several distinct syndromes which are characteristicof particular dose ranges, and which are due to injury in speciﬁc organ systems.
(A 71) For a speciﬁc syndrome potentially leading to death, the relationship be-
tween the percentage of survivors and the dose is sigmoid in shape on a linear plot,whereas for a transformed probability-linear plot the shape is approximately linear
(Fig. A.3.2b). The survival–dose relationship is often described by its midpoint, the
LD
50, i.e., the dose that is lethal for half of the individuals, and the slope of the
curve. The slope can be characterised by the probit width, which is the standard devi-ation of the distribution, or by other parameters in other transformations of thedata. Values of LD
5-10and LD 90-95 are helpful in assessments of the dose that will
result in the death of only a few or of many.Table A.3.1. Estimates of the thresholds for tissue eﬀects in the adult human testes, ovaries, lens, and bone

164(A 72) For a normal healthy adult human, the LD 50/60, i.e., within 60 days, is
around 4 Gy midline dose, but there are estimates in the literature ranging from 3to 5 Gy. Estimates of LD
10are around 1–2 Gy, and around 5–7 Gy for LD 90
(UNSCEAR, 1988 Annex G, NUREG, 1997). The cause of death is haemopoieticfailure, resulting primarily from a lack of progenitor cells that produce functional
short-lived granulocytes, as well as from haemorrhages without the replacement of
radioresistant red cells. It is possible to improve the chances of survival of individualsexposed to doses around or even above the LD
50/60by appropriate medical care such
as ﬂuid replacement, antibiotics, antifungal drugs, and barrier nursing (UNSCEAR,1988 Annex G), by infusing platelets and concentrates of isologous blood stem cells,and by injecting growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulatingfactor. Some experts have considered that supportive medical treatment may increasethe LD
50/60to around 5 Gy, and possibly to around 6 Gy if growth factors are also
employed (NUREG, 1997). In experimental animal systems these procedures have
been shown to signiﬁcantly increase the LD 50values (Table A.3.2). Growth factors
have been used for many years in the treatment of humans following whole body irra-diation for haematological diseases. However, in the few cases of accidental radiationexposures where they have been used, they did not save the individuals who were con-sidered at risk of death, possibly because of the delay in starting treatment. Althoughthe growth factors were considered to be of some beneﬁt in the early post-exposureperiod, treated individuals died from organ reactions such as pneumonitis.
(A 73) At doses in excess of about 5 Gy, additional eﬀects occur, including severe
gastrointestinal (stem cell and endothelial capillary cell) damage which, when com-bined with haemopoietic damage, causes death in 1–2 weeks. There are few humandata to assess accurately the LD
50for this syndrome, but it may be approaching 10
Gy acute dose (UNSCEAR, 1988 Annex G, NUREG, 1997), and supportive medicaltreatment and growth factors are expected to increase this approximate value. Ifsome marrow and most of the gut have been spared because of inhomogeneous irra-diation, then at acute doses above 10 Gy to the lungs, acute inﬂammation (pneumo-
nitis) may occur leading to death. Renal damage also occurs in the same dose range,
if the kidneys have been irradiated. All these eﬀects potentially can be alleviated tosome extent, as evidenced by the success of growth factors and other molecules inreducing tissue and organ injury in animal systems after irradiation (Table A.3.2).At even higher doses towards 50 Gy and above, there is acute damage in the nervousand cardiovascular systems and the individual dies of shock after a few days (NCRP,1974). Approximate doses for death at diﬀerent times are given in Table A.3.3. Theseare for high dose, low LET radiation given over a few minutes.
(A 74) If the dose is given over a period of hours or more it requires a greater
whole body dose for these eﬀects to occur. For example, if the dose rate is about0.2 Gy per hour, LD
50values may be increased by around 50% (NUREG, 1997).
If the dose is delivered over a month, the LD 50/60 may be doubled (UNSCEAR,
1988 Annex G). At low (chronic) radiation dose rates, there is evidence of a chronicradiation syndrome aﬀecting in particular the haemopoietic, immune and neural sys-tems (Guskova et al., 2002, AFRRI, 1994, 1998, Akleyev and Kisselyov, 2002). Thethreshold doses for depression of the immune system is about 0.3–0.5 Gy per yearICRP Publication 103
165(Akleyev et al., 1999), and estimated threshold doses for eﬀects in other organs are
given in Table A.3.1. Severe reactions do not occur in most body tissues of adults orchildren after annual doses below 0.1 Gy over many years. Red bone marrow, repro-ductive cells, and the lens of the eye show the greatest sensitivity.Table A.3.2. Dose-modifying factors (DMF) reported in mice or other

166(A 75) Tissue and organ reactions resulting from exposure to high LET irradiation
are similar to those from low LET exposure, but their frequency and severity aregreater per unit absorbed dose of high LET irradiation. These diﬀerences are ex-pressed in terms of the relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) for the eﬀect underconsideration. The RBE of high versus low LET radiation is deﬁned as the ratioof absorbed doses of the reference low LET radiation and the high LET radiationthat result in the same level of biological eﬀect.
(A 76) RBE values for tissue and organ reactions are higher at lower doses and
also when low doses per fraction are given repeatedly to accumulate the total dose
(Publication 58 , ICRP 1989b). RBE values tend to be smaller for early eﬀects in hae-
mopoietic and reproductive tissue, larger for gastrointestinal tract and skin, and evenlarger for late reactions in, for example, lung and kidney.
(A 77) The eﬀective maximum RBE will be that value which applies at the thresh-
old dose for the particular eﬀect under consideration. This will be less than the valueRBE
M, which is deﬁned as the ratio of such doses at very low doses. This is the ratio
of the linear components of the linear-quadratic ﬁttings to data at higher doses.
Hence it represents an extrapolation to dose levels below the threshold dose, which
is of theoretical but not of practical interest. It also ignores the possibility of occulthypersensitivity at very low doses (see Section 3.1, paragraphs (A 59)–(A 63). RBE
M
values for neutrons are 2–5 times lower, and eﬀective maximum RBE values are evenlower than values of RBE
Mfor stochastic eﬀects in corresponding tissues. Thus the
use of QorwRvalues in cases where tissue eﬀects are over-riding would result in an
overestimate of the contribution to the risk from high LET radiation.
Summary of projected estimates of dose thresholds for morbidity and mortality
(A 78) For the purposes of developing judgements for the present ICRP Recom-
mendations, the Commission decided to update and summarise threshold estimatesof the acute absorbed doses for 1% incidences of morbidity and mortality involv-ing adult human organs and tissues after whole body gamma ray exposures.These 1% incidence estimates, derived from publications which utilise mathematicalTable A.3.3.

Dose limits for speciﬁc tissues
(A 79) Publication 60 (ICRP 1991b, paragraph 194 and Table 6) describes the need
to provide dose limits for exposure of the eye and localised areas of the skin becausethese tissues are not necessarily protected against radiation-induced reaction/injuryby the limit on eﬀective dose which, in these circumstances, protects against cancer
development.
(A 80) Information available since 1990 has not provided evidence necessitating a
change of view of the tumorigenic radiosensitivity of the skin or relevant subcutane-ous tissues. It is judged therefore that the occupational and public dose limits for theskin and hands/feet given in Table 6 of Publication 60 remain applicable. However,
recent studies have suggested that the lens of the eye may be more radiosensitive thanpreviously considered. In particular, among both A-bomb survivors (Minamotoet al., 2004) and a group of children treated for skin haemangioma (Hall et al.,
1999), there is evidence of excesses of both cortical and posterior subcapsular cataract
at doses somewhat lower than expected. In the assignment of a dose threshold for cat-aract, uncertainties are recognised on the mechanisms of cataract development, andTable A.3.4. Projected threshold estimates of the acute absorbed doses for 1% incidences of morbidity and

A.3.2. Eﬀects in the embryo and fetus
(A 81) The risks of tissue injury and developmental changes (including malforma-
tions) in the irradiated embryo and fetus have been reviewed recently in Publication
90(ICRP, 2003a). In the main, this review reinforced the judgements on in-utero
risks given in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) although, on some issues, new data allow
for clariﬁcation of views. On the basis of Publication 90 , the following conclusions
can be summarised on the in-utero risks of tissue injury and malformation at doses
up to a few tens of mGy low LET.
(A 82) The new data from animal studies conﬁrm embryonic sensitivity to the
lethal eﬀects of irradiation in the pre-implantation period of embryonic develop-ments. At doses of a few tens of mGy such lethal eﬀects will be very infrequent,and the data reviewed provide no reason to believe that there will be signiﬁcant risksto health expressed after birth.
(A 83) In respect of the induction of malformations, the animal data strengthen
the view that there are gestation age-dependent patterns of in-utero radiosensitivity
with maximum sensitivity being expressed during the period of major organogenesis.
On the basis of these animal data it is judged that there is a dose threshold of around100 mGy for the induction of malformations; therefore, for practical purposes, risksof malformation after low-dose in-utero exposure may be discounted. Publication 90
(ICRP 2003a) reviews the experimental data on neurodevelopment following in-utero irradiation for which dose thresholds generally apply; it also considers humanepidemiological data as summarised below.
(A 84) The review of human A-bomb data on the induction of severe mental
retardation after irradiation in the most sensitive prenatal period (8–15 weeks post
conception) now more clearly supports a dose threshold of at least 300 mGy forthis eﬀect and therefore the absence of risk at low doses. The associated data onIQ losses estimated at around 25 points per Gy are more diﬃcult to interpretand their signiﬁcance is unclear. Although a non-threshold dose response cannotbe excluded, even in the absence of a true dose threshold, any eﬀects on IQ follow-ing in-utero doses of a few tens of mGy would be of no practical signiﬁcance forthe vast majority of individuals. This judgement accords with that developed in
Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b).

171A.4. Risks of radiation-induced cancer
(A 85) In the development of judgements on the risk of radiation-induced cancer
in the dose range up to around 100 mSv, the Commission has given attention to:a) the implications of fundamental data on radiation response; b) quantitative
aspects of animal tumorigenesis; and c) direct epidemiological observation of cancer
risk in humans, albeit at doses generally greater than 100 mSv. The conclusionsreached by the Commission on the implications of fundamental and animal dataare used: i) to guide the projection of higher dose epidemiological data for the pur-poses of estimating cancer risk in the low dose region of interest; and ii) to considerthe application of a dose and dose rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) that wouldapply to human exposures at low doses and low dose rates. Judgements developedin Section A.6 on heritable eﬀects are brought forward in order to provide new
estimates of detriment and the nominal risk coeﬃcients for risk in a single section
of the Annex.
A.4.1. Fundamental data on radiation response
(A 86) In formulating Recommendations for protecting humans against the
tumorigenic eﬀects of radiation, the Commission is required to consider a very broadspan of biological data and concepts; many of these are subject to ongoing debate
and, in some cases, contention. There is, however, general agreement that epidemi-
ological methods used for the estimation of cancer risk do not have the power to di-rectly reveal cancer risks in the dose range up to around 100 mSv. Accordingly thereis a growing role for biological data in the development of ICRP Recommendationsand, where there is uncertainty and/or contention, there is a need to arrive at a sci-entiﬁcally balanced judgement based upon peer-reviewed data.
(A 87) The principal criteria used by the Commission in seeking a balanced view of
biological data are captured in the questions given below.
/C15How relevant to in-vivo human tumorigenesis are the radiobiological end-points
in question?
/C15Is the design, methodology and statistical strength of a given study suﬃcient to
support the published conclusions?
/C15Do these published conclusions accord with those of similar studies and take ade-quate account of other relevant experimental data?
Where there are conﬂicting data and concepts:
/C15Which of the conﬂicting elements show greatest coherence with fundamental
knowledge of the cancer process in general and, where possible, with epidemiolog-ical data?
/C15How critical is the issue for the broad purposes of radiological protection?
(A 88) These questions have been applied to a large set of published cancer-related
fundamental data considered by ICRP Committee 1 and by other committees withinterests in radiation cancer risk (e.g., UNSCEAR 2000, NCRP 2001, NAS/NRCICRP Publication 103
1732006, ICRP 2005d). From this evaluation the following judgements have been devel-
oped by the Commission.
Dose-response relationships for gene and chromosomal mutations
(A 89) On the basis that the induction, by radiation, of gene and chromosomal
mutations is of direct importance to the cancer process, the majority of relevant data
from cellular studies is compatible with a simple relationship between dose andeﬀect. A linear-quadratic form generally describes the full dose response for lowLET radiations. The most informative data, although sparse, suggest linearity downto doses of a few tens of mGy, and there is no good reason to suggest a departurefrom this simple proportionality in the dose range down to a few mGy. At lowLET radiation doses of a few mGy and below, linearity of response for targetedevents in cells is expected because the ﬂuence of tracks becomes equal to or less than
the number of cells in the radiation ﬁeld (see Section A.2.1). If, however, bystander
eﬀects were to be shown to contribute substantially to low-dose cellular eﬀects ingeneral then this expectation might not be met.
DNA damage response in cells
(A 90) There is much data to support the view that the activity of DNA damage
response processes in cells is closely coupled with both cellular radiobiological eﬀectsand cancer development. On this basis the ﬁdelity of post-irradiation DNA repair is
expected to be a critical determinant of low-dose response. Current data point
towards the predominance of an inherently error-prone repair process for the chem-ically complex DNA double-strand lesions that are characteristic of radiation action.Error-prone DNA repair at doses down to a few tens of mGy is consistent with theapproximate linearity of cellular dose response for gene/chromosomal mutations andimplies a simple proportionality between dose and the cancer risk associated withsuch mutations. The possibility of biochemical changes in DNA repair ﬁdelity atdoses below a few tens of mGy cannot be excluded but there are no speciﬁc reasons
to predict such changes.
(A 91) A challenge to this conventional scientiﬁc view has come from proposals
based upon the capacity of cells to sustain and repair a relatively high ﬂux of spon-taneously arising oxidative damage to DNA (see UNSCEAR 2000, NAS/NRC 2006,ICRP 2005d). The issue raised is that if cells can deal adequately with this relativelyhigh level of spontaneous DNA damage then a small number of additional DNA le-sions resulting from exposure to a few tens of mGy ( /C242 DNA double-strand lesions
or/C241 complex cluster per cell at /C2450 mGy low LET) would be of little or no con-
sequence for cancer risk.
(A 92) This challenge might have some strength if spontaneously arising and radi-
ation-induced DNA lesions were of the same type. However, as noted in SectionsA.2.1 and A.2.3, there is good reason to believe that the clustered and chemicallycomplex DNA lesions characteristic of radiation action arise very infrequently fromspontaneous oxidative processes in cells; these oxidative processes tend to result insimple and readily repairable damage to the single strands of DNA. Since complexICRP Publication 103
174DNA lesions are inherently diﬃcult to repair correctly, the challenging argument
loses much of its scientiﬁc strength.
(A 93) These issues have been addressed in detail by UNSCEAR (2000), NAS/
NRC (2006) and ICRP (2005d) and, for the reasons summarised above, the Commis-sion concludes that the balance of evidence weighs against challenges to simple pro-
portionality in low-dose response that is based upon the relative abundances of
spontaneous and radiation-induced DNA damage.
(A 94) It has also been proposed that simple proportionality between dose and
radiobiological eﬀect may not apply in all circumstances because of the activity ofthe adaptive DNA damage-response processes noted in Section A.2.3. The Commis-sion recognises that the data on adaptive responses in human lymphocytes is reason-ably reproducible but even these data show that this form of response is notconsistently expressed in cell strains and has a poorly understood mechanistic basis.
Other forms of adaptive response, e.g., immunological stimulation, considered by
UNSCEAR (1994, 2000), and that were seen in some recent animal studies ontumorigenesis (Mitchel et al., 1999, 2003), are also judged to have most uncertainbiological bases.
(A 95) Similar conclusions have been drawn by the BEIR VII Committee (NAS/
NRC, 2006). The Commission does, however, recognise that the dose-dependenceof post-irradiation cellular signalling and its potential implications for DNA dam-age response and cancer risk is an area where more information is needed. A report
from the French Academies (2005) emphasises the potential importance of such cel-
lular signalling and cites other data to support arguments in favour of a practicalthreshold for low-dose cancer risk (see also Section A.4.4, paragraphs A 178–A187).
(A 96) Overall, the Commission concludes that the concept of adaptive responses
to radiation lacks adequate biological support, and the available data fail to providegood evidence of robust adaptive and protective eﬀects for cancer. The integration ofthe concept of adaptive response into a biological framework for radiological protec-
tion is therefore judged to be unjustiﬁed at this time.
Epigenetic responses to radiation
(A 97) Although the Commission is well aware that research is proceeding at a
good pace, the available data do not provide good evidence of a robust causal asso-ciation between cancer risk and the epigenetic phenomena of induced genomic insta-bility and bystander signalling. It seems likely that diverse stress-related cellularprocesses underlie the expression of both types of response, but there is much uncer-
tainty on dose-response characteristics, the extent to which in-vivo expression
occurs, and how this might inﬂuence cancer risk. On this basis, the Commissionsuggests that, at present, it is not possible to meaningfully integrate data on theseprocesses into the low-dose judgements necessary for radiological protection.Indeed, since direct human epidemiological data at low LET doses of above around100 mGy provide the principal means for estimating nominal cancer risk coeﬃcients,at these doses cancer risk estimates will incorporate all relevant biological processesincluding the epigenetic factors noted in this Annex. The critical issue of uncertaintyICRP Publication 103
175is therefore not simply whether such epigenetic factors inﬂuence cancer risk per se
but rather whether the in-vivo dose response characteristics might provide for diﬀer-ential contributions to risk at, say, 200 mSv compared with, say, 10 mSv. The BEIRVII (NAS/NRC, 2006) and CERRIE (2004) Committees have also commented onthe uncertain contribution of these epigenetic processes to radiation tumour risk.
A.4.2. Animal data on tumour induction and life shortening
(A 98) Animal data, largely from rodent studies, were included in consideration of
relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c) and have been
reviewed in Publication 99 (ICRP, 2005d) in respect of dose response and judgements
on the dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF). The relationship betweenRBE and radiation weighting ( w
R) is adequately summarised in Publication 92 and
further developed in Publication 99.
(A 99) In respect of dose response, the most reliable animal data are generally
compatible with a simple proportionate relationship between dose and risk but thereare examples of highly curvilinear threshold-like responses for the induction of thy-mic lymphoma and ovarian cancer in mice. The processes that underlie the inductionof these tumour types have a high degree of dependence upon cell killing and, for thisreason, these responses are judged by the Commission to be atypical (see ICRP2005d).
(A 100) When mouse data for thymic lymphoma and ovarian cancers are excluded
from analyses the values for DDREF from animal studies are generally compatibleand, at doses at or below around 2 Gy, a DDREF value of about 2 is implied.
A.4.3. Relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) and radiation weighting ( w
R)
(A 101) The relationships between RBE and wRwere reviewed in Publication 92
(ICRP 2003c). The outcome of this review, which involved input from ICRP Com-
mittees 1 and 2, was a recommendation that although the wRvalues for protons and
neutrons required revision, wRvalues for other radiations given in Publication 60
(ICRP 1991b) remained appropriate.
(A 102) For protons of energy >2 MeV it was judged in Publication 92 that the wR
value of 5 given in Publication 60 is a signiﬁcant overestimate of their biological eﬀec-
tiveness and for incident protons of practical importance (> 10 MeV) a wRof 2 was
proposed. For neutrons, Publication 92 proposed that ICRP continues the use of wR
values that depend upon the energy of the incident neutrons. However, the contin-
uous function given in Publication 92 (Fig. 1 on page 3) was recommended rather
than the step function given in Publication 60 .Publication 92 noted that, for practical
purposes, this procedure will reduce problems of computation of eﬀective dose butshould not be taken to imply precise knowledge of the underlying biological eﬀec-tiveness. The issues of w
Rfor neutrons and photons/electrons have been considered
further by ICRP Committee 2, and detailed judgements are given in Annex B ofthese Recommendations.ICRP Publication 103
176(A 103) Those Auger-emitting radionuclides and compounds that have the poten-
tial to localise to the cell nucleus and bind to DNA were recognised in Publication 60
as a special case for low-LET radiation. The Commission supports the view given inPublication 92 that Auger emitters will continue to need special attention in radiolog-
ical protection and that speciﬁc physiological and biophysical data would be needed
in order to consider Auger-emitting compounds on a case-by-case basis.
A.4.4. Estimation of cancer risk from epidemiological data
(A 104) The Task Group that drafted this Annex was speciﬁcally charged by the
Commission with developing nominal risk coeﬃcients for cancer risk and providingrecommendations on the transport of risk between populations, the estimation ofradiation detriment and the derivation of tissue weighting factors. This was a major
new element of work for ICRP Committee 1 and required input from Committee 2
and the Commission. The outcome of this work is summarised below.
Nominal risk coeﬃcients, radiation detriment, and tissue weighting factors
(A 105) Nominal risk coeﬃcients are derived by averaging sex and age-at-expo-
sure lifetime risk estimates in representative populations. In general, cohort studieswere preferred for risk assessment, because in retrospective case-control studies,selection biases may be a problem and the dose estimates can be highly uncertain
when exposure data come from personal recall without documentation. The lifetime
risk estimates are computed using risk estimates speciﬁc to various cancer sites.Radiation risk estimates are derived for incidence data for speciﬁc tumour siteswhen adequate dose response data are available from the Japanese Life Span Study(LSS), pooled analyses of multiple studies, or other sources. Incidence data tend tohave less diagnostic misclassiﬁcation than mortality data and provide better esti-mates for sites that have relatively low lethality. To simplify risk calculations byusers of the ICRP system, estimates are derived for males and females combined.
Because of the uncertainty in applying risk models generated from one population
to another population with diﬀerent cancer patterns, population-speciﬁc nominalrisks are averages of risk estimates from alternative models; these are discussedin paragraphs A 110 – A 124. These nominal risks are computed for each site ofinterest and summed to give the population total nominal risk. The overall site-spe-ciﬁc and total nominal risks are computed by averaging the population-speciﬁcaverage risks.
(A 106) Radiation detriment is a concept used to quantify the harmful eﬀects of
radiation exposure in diﬀerent parts of the body. It is determined from nominal risk
coeﬃcients, taking into account the severity of the disease in terms of lethality andyears of life lost. Total detriment is the sum of the detriment for each part of thebody (tissues and/or organs).
(A 107) The concept of ‘eﬀective dose’ associated with a given exposure involves
weighting individual organs and tissues of interest by the relative detriments for theseparts of the body. In such a system, the weighted sum of the tissue-speciﬁc doseequivalents, called the eﬀective dose, should be proportional to the total estimatedICRP Publication 103
177detriment from the exposure, whatever the distribution of equivalent dose within the
body. The components of detriment are essentially the same for cancer and heritabledisease and, if desired, these detriments may be combined.
(A 108) In general, the risk estimates summarised here are derived as averages
across Asian and Euro-American populations. An attempt was made to choose an
appropriate model to use for transferring risks across various populations whenever
there is suﬃcient evidence to favour one model over another. The risk modelling wasconducted principally with the data from the Japanese Life Span Study of A-bombsurvivors (LSS), but the broader radiation epidemiology literature was examined forcompatibility with the LSS-derived estimates. For several tissues it was possible touse a group of data sets to estimate cancer risk.
(A 109) The following text brieﬂy outlines the general models of risk and the
sources of data used, methodological aspects of the risk estimates, and the
detriments associated with a range of tissues. Estimated numerical values and recom-
mendations that derive from this work are summarised in Tables A.4.1, A.4.3, andA.4.4.
(A 110) Risk modelling. Within a given exposed population, comparable descrip-
tions of the radiation-associated risk can be made using either excess relative risk(ERR) or excess absolute risk (EAR) models, so long as the models allow for vari-ation in the excess risk with factors such as sex, attained age, and age-at-exposure.While suitably data-rich multiplicative (ERR) or additive (EAR) models lead to vir-
tually identical descriptions of the excess risk in the population used to develop the
risk estimates, they can lead to markedly diﬀerent excess risk estimates when appliedto populations with diﬀerent baseline rates.
(A 111) Both ERR and EAR models were developed for oesophagus, stomach,
colon, liver, lung, breast, ovary, bladder, thyroid and leukaemia (bone marrow).As noted below, Publication 60 nominal risks were used for bone and skin cancers
(ICRP, 1991b). Because the data for other human tissues and organs are insuﬃcientto individually judge the magnitude of their radiation risk, they were consigned to a
‘remainder’ category (called ‘other solid’). ERR and EAR models were also devel-
oped for this group.
(A 112) In general, the parameters in these risk models were estimated using inci-
dence data from the studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors with follow-upfrom 1958 through to 1998 for solid cancers (Preston et al., 2007). For solid cancersthese models involved a linear dose response allowing for modifying eﬀects of sex,exposure age, and attained age. These eﬀects were constrained to equal the valuesseen for all solid cancers as a group unless there were indications that these con-
straints resulted in a marked reduction in the goodness of ﬁt when modelling
cause-speciﬁc cancer types. Leukaemia risk estimates were based on an EAR modelwith a linear-quadratic dose response that allows for eﬀect modiﬁcation by sex, expo-sure age, and time following exposure (Preston et al., 1994). Model parameters aregiven in Section A.4.5.
(A 113) While the LSS studies do provide some information on skin cancer risks
(Ron et al., 1998), it was judged that they may not be adequate for a general popu-lation because of diﬀerences in risk related to skin pigmentation. Therefore, theICRP Publication 103
178Commission used the nominal skin cancer risk estimate of 0.1 per Gy from Publica-
tion 59 (ICRP, 1991a). This estimate was also used in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b).
The nominal risk estimate for bone was also taken from Publication 60 because the
LSS atomic bomb studies provide no data, and other data sources were extremelylimited. The low-LET estimate used in Publication 60 was 0.00065 per Gy. It shouldTable A.4.1. Summary of sex-averaged nominal risks and detriment.

Additional notes: The BEIR VII estimates are based on application of the BEIR VII risk models to the
combined Euro-American and Asian populations with an assumed DDREF of 2. Nominal risks anddetriment values would be increased by 4/3 if the BEIR VII DDREF of 1.5 were used. BEIR VII risks forskin, bone surface, and gonads are taken as the same as the ICRP values since risk estimates for these
outcomes were not considered in the BEIR VII lifetime risk estimates. The ‘Current ICRP 60’ estimates
are based on application of the Publication 60 risk models to the Euro-American and Asian populations
used here with an assumed DDREF of 2. The ‘ICRP 60 actual’ estimates were determined from the data in
Publication 60 .ICRP Publication 103
181be noted that the ICRP risk estimate for bone cancer was based on average bone
dose from radium–244 while current dosimetric models estimate doses to bone sur-faces. As discussed by Puskin et al. (1992), the risk estimate would be a factor of 9lower if calculated on the basis of dose to the bone surface. However, proposedchanges in bone dosimetry will reduce this diﬀerence. For the purposes of the present
report, the risk estimate based on average bone dose is used while recognising its pos-
sible conservatism.
(A 114) The risk models described above were used to compute sex-speciﬁc life-
time risk estimates for a range of ages at exposure (0 to 85 years in 5-year intervals)in Asian and Euro-American composite populations as described subsequently.Lifetime risks for exposure ages were then averaged using weights reﬂecting theage distribution of the full population or for a working age (18–64 year old)population.
(A 115) In Publication 60 , nominal cancer risks were computed based on mortality
data but, in the current report, risk estimates are based principally on incidence data.The reason for the change is that incidence data provide a more complete descriptionof the cancer burden than do mortality data, particularly for cancers that have a highsurvival rate. In addition, cancer registry (incidence) diagnoses are more accurateand the time of diagnosis is more precise. It is recognised, however, that incompletecoverage of the A-bomb population because of migration from Hiroshima or Naga-saki introduces a factor of uncertainty on risk estimates based on these cancer inci-
dence data. At the time of Publication 60 , comprehensive incidence data were not
available. Since then, a thorough evaluation of cancer incidence in the Life SpanStudy (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has been published (Thompsonet al., 1994; Preston et al., 1994). Site-speciﬁc risk estimates were taken from the mostrecent solid cancer incidence analyses of the atomic bomb survivor LSS (PrestonTable A.4.3. Proposed tissue weighting factors.

in risk estimates that is due to uncertainty in individual dose estimates (Pierce et al.,1990). The newly implemented atomic bomb dosimetry system, DS02, is a consider-able improvement over DS86. On average, the DS02 dose estimates are slightlygreater than the DS86 estimates. Risk estimates using the two systems diﬀer by less
than 10% (Preston et al., 2004).

data, information from other radiation-exposed populations was also considered.Such information is available from studies of:

/C15Workers exposed to radiation in the course of their job, e.g., uranium miners;
/C15Persons with environmental exposures, e.g., from fallout or from natural
radiation.
(A 117) These studies have been reviewed in detail by UNSCEAR (2000) and the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 2000, 2001). Some of these
studies are more informative than others about radiation risks. The LSS is partic-
ularly valuable in estimating radiation risks for a general population, because ofthe very long, mainly prospective follow-up, the large size of the cohort, and theinclusion of persons of all ages and both sexes who received a wide range of doses.In contrast, many studies of medical exposures lack the sample size and dosimetryquality for precise estimation of risk as a function of dose (NAS/NRC 2006). Also,studies of therapeutic exposures often involve doses in excess of 5 Gy, where cellkilling may lead to an under-estimation of the cancer risk per unit dose.
(A 118) However, studies other than the LSS can provide information on the
eﬀects of exposure received under diﬀerent circumstances, such as exposure tohigh-LET rather than low-LET radiation, exposures received in a chronic or frac-tionated manner rather than acutely, or risks in countries other than Japan. Forexample, because the baseline rates of breast cancer are very low in Japan, datafrom seven cohorts in North America and Western Europe were used in additionto the LSS for determining the site-speciﬁc risk estimate (Preston et al. 2002). Also,for thyroid cancer, data from four populations exposed to radiation for medical
reasons in various countries were considered in addition to the LSS (Ron et al.
1995). As mentioned earlier, the nominal risk estimates for bone and skin are thoseused in Publication 60 (ICRP 1991b). These estimates are largely based on studies
of groups with medical exposures (e.g., intakes of radium–224 in the case ofbone).
(A 119) For cancers at some sites there is reasonable compatibility between the
data from the LSS and those from other sources. However, it is recognised by theCommission that there are indications of diﬀerences in radiation risks for a number
of sites, e.g., lung when compared with radon-exposed miners (UNSCEAR 2000),
although here the diﬀerences – within a factor of 2–3 – are not large relative tothe uncertainties in these estimates. More direct information on the eﬀects of lowlevel radon exposures comes from recent combined analyses of case-control studiesthat show raised risks of lung cancer from radon exposure in homes (Darby et al.ICRP Publication 103
1832005, Krewski et al. 2005, Lubin et al. 2004). Precise comparison with estimates
based on the LSS and the miner studies is diﬃcult but, bearing in mind the variousuncertainties, the ﬁndings appear to be broadly compatible. In Publication 60 , the
liver cancer risk estimate was derived from studies of patients injected with the radio-active contrast medium Thorotrast, whilst in the current report the LSS liver cancer
risk estimate was preferred. The LSS estimate is higher than that of other groups ex-
posed to x or gamma radiation (UNSCEAR 2000), probably because of a reportedstrong interaction between hepatitis virus and radiation in the LSS (Sharp et al.2003). However, as indicated below, the estimate derived here based on the LSS issimilar to that in Publication 60 . More generally, when the LSS cancer incidence risks
were compared to those from medically or occupationally irradiated populations ex-posed to low-LET external radiation, the risk estimates were broadly compatible(NAS/NRC 2006).
(A 120) Cancer risk in diﬀerent tissues. Nominal cancer risks and tissue weights
were developed for 12 tissues and organs (oesophagus, stomach, colon, liver, lung,bone, skin, breast, ovary, bladder, thyroid, and red bone marrow) with the remain-ing tissues and organs grouped into one ‘remainder’ category. These individual tis-sues and organs were selected because it was deemed that there was suﬃcientepidemiological information on the tumorigenic eﬀects of radiation to make thejudgements that were necessary for estimating cancer risks. Leukaemia, excludingchronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma were included in the
bone marrow category. The remainder category also includes other tissues not
explicitly evaluated as individual cancer sites.
(A 121) Composite populations. Composite baseline rates were computed using
incidence rates averaged across six populations for cancers of the oesophagus, stom-ach, colon, liver, lung, female breast, ovary, bladder, thyroid, leukaemia (excludingCLL) and solid cancers combined. The aim was to compile rates for representativepopulations in diﬀerent parts of the world. Population-based cancer incidence rateswere obtained from the 8th edition of Cancer Incidence In Five Continents (Parkin
et al. 2002) and population size data were obtained from the WHO international
mortality statistics database. In Annex B of Publication 60 (ICRP 1991b), risks were
calculated separately for ﬁve diﬀerent populations. The approach taken here isslightly diﬀerent, in that cancer rates were compiled for selected Asian (Shanghai,Osaka, Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and Euro-American (Sweden, United Kingdom,US SEER) populations with long-running cancer registries. These rates are shownin Section A.4.5. An unweighted average of the Asian and the Euro-American datawas calculated to form a composite population.
(A 122) Sex-speciﬁc, all-stage relative survival statistics from the US SEER pro-
gramme for 1994–1999 (5-year survival) and 1979–1999 (20-year survival) were aver-aged to compute overall relative survival rates for diﬀerent cancer sites. Although theSEER relative survival rates are higher than those found for many other Europeanand Asian countries, reducing the survival rates did not change estimates of relativedetriment appreciably.
(A 123) Heritable risks. The estimate of genetic (heritable) risk from radiation has
been substantially revised since the Publication 60 report as a result of both newICRP Publication 103
184information that has become available and the work of ICRP during the interim.
These revised estimates and their derivation are given in Section A.6. Several factorshave led to this revision of genetic risk estimates; in brief:
/C15Most radiation-induced mutations are large multigene deletions, which are morelikely to cause multisystem developmental abnormalities rather than single-gene(i.e., Mendelian) diseases. Importantly, only a fraction of these are likely to be
compatible with live births.
/C15Nearly all chronic diseases have a genetic component, but because most of these
are multigenic and multifactorial, the mutation component (i.e., the responsive-ness of these diseases to an alteration in mutation rate) is small, so that chronicdiseases respond only minimally to a radiation-induced increase in mutation rate.
/C15Publication 60 (ICRP 1991b) made the implicit assumption that all genetic dis-
eases should be treated as lethal. In view of the range of severity and lethalityfor the various types of genetic disease, the lethality fraction for genetic diseaseshas now been explicitly designated as 80%.
/C15New genetic risk coeﬃcients recommended by ICRP consider exposure andgenetic risk for two generations only; the equilibrium value used in Publication
60is judged to be of limited scientiﬁc validity because of the unsupported assump-
tions necessary on selection coeﬃcients, mutation component and populationchanges over hundreds of years.
(A 124) As a result, the risk of heritable eﬀects in the whole population associated
with gonadal dose is now estimated to be around 20 cases per 10,000 people per Sv,rather than around 100 cases per 10,000 per Sv in Publication 60 (see Section 6, Table
6.6). As in Publication 60 , the risk of heritable eﬀects in the working population is
taken to be 60% of that for the whole population. The corresponding relative con-
tribution of the gonadal dose to the total detriment is now estimated as 3–4%, versus
the former /C2418%.
(A 125) Methodological aspects. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. There are
uncertainties in radiation risk estimates which stem from several sources. The mostfamiliar is statistical uncertainty, represented by conﬁdence limits or statistical like-lihood distributions. For a chronic or low-dose exposure, the estimate and its statis-tical uncertainty are divided by an uncertain dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor(DDREF), a process that both reduces the estimate and further increases its uncer-
tainty (see below).
(A 126) When an estimate based on a particular exposed population is applied to
other populations or to other radiation sources, further uncertainty is introduced.Diﬀerences between radiation sources can produce uncertainty owing to randomor systematic error in dose estimates in either the original or the secondarypopulation.
(A 127) Risk-based radiological protection depends heavily on the assumption
that estimates based on studies of informative exposed populations, such as the Life
Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, can be applied to other exposed pop-
ulations. Combined analyses of dose-response data from diﬀerent populations (e.g.,Preston et al. 2002) provide valuable information relevant to that assumption.ICRP Publication 103
185Unfortunately, such information is available for very few site-speciﬁc cancers. Trans-
fers of risk estimates between populations pose a particularly diﬃcult problem forcancer sites for which baseline rates diﬀer widely between the two populations. Thisproblem is discussed in more detail below.
(A 128) Other major sources of uncertainty include possible interaction of radia-
tion exposure with other cancer risk factors, notably including smoking history in
the case of lung cancer, and reproductive history in the case of female breast cancer.This problem is similar to that of transfer of risk estimates between populations, inthat the interaction can be represented as an uncertain linear combination of anadditive and a multiplicative model. However, there is epidemiological evidencefavouring an additive or submultiplicative interaction in the case of lung cancerand smoking (Pierce et al. 2003, Travis et al. 2002, Lubin et al. 1995), and a multi-plicative interaction in the case of breast cancer and reproductive history (Land et al.
1994).
(A 129) Another source of uncertainty is the relative biological eﬀectiveness, rela-
tive to high-energy photons, of radiations of diﬀerent qualities including medicalx rays in the 30–200 keV range, electrons, neutrons, protons, and alpha particles.Quantiﬁcation of such uncertainties has been discussed in detail elsewhere, e.g.,NCI/CDC (2003). The use of central values is preferred by the Commission forradiological protection purposes, but it should be kept in mind that RBE valuesfor speciﬁc radiations are intrinsically uncertain. Other aspects of uncertainty asso-
ciated with the possible existence of a low-dose threshold for cancer risk are summa-
rised in Section A.4.4, paragraphs A 173 – A 187. Uncertainties associated with doseestimates for internal radionuclides (e.g., CERRIE, 2004) are noted in Publication 99
(ICRP, 2005d).
(A 130) Dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor. Because it is diﬃcult to detect small
risks in epidemiological studies, the dose-speciﬁc estimates of radiation-related riskin this report are largely determined by people exposed to acute doses of 200 mSvor greater. However, many of the more contentious issues in radiation protection in-
volve risks from continuous exposures, or fractionated exposures with acute frac-
tions of a few mSv or less. Experimental investigations tend to show thatfractionation or protraction of dose is associated with reduced risk, suggesting thatdose-speciﬁc estimates based on high-dose, acute exposure data should be divided bya dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) for applications to low-dose, con-tinuous, or fractionated exposures.
(A 131) As already noted, direct estimation from epidemiological studies of cancer
risks from doses below a few hundred mSv is diﬃcult, largely for reasons of statis-
tical power. Combined analyses of datasets can help increase statistical power,
although precise estimation of risks is currently not possible. A recent example con-cerns a combined analysis of data on cancer mortality among nuclear workers in 15countries (Cardis et al. 2005). Notwithstanding the large population (around 400,000workers in the main analysis), the cohort is still relatively young and only 6% of theworkers had died by the end of follow-up. Consequently, the conﬁdence intervals forthe estimated trends in cancer risk with dose were wide. In particular, the ﬁndingswere consistent with risks extrapolated from high-dose, acute exposure data usingICRP Publication 103
186a DDREF of 2, as well as with a range of other values. Furthermore, part of the in-
creased risk observed for cancers other than leukaemia appeared to be due to con-founding caused by smoking. This highlights the impact that relatively smallbiases might have on studies at low doses.
(A 132) The magnitude of DDREF is uncertain, and has been treated as such in a
number of recent reports based on quantitative uncertainty analysis; for example,
NCRP (1997), EPA (1999), and NCI/CDC (2003). However, the mean of the prob-abilistic uncertainty distribution for DDREF employed in those analyses diﬀers littlefrom the value of 2 recommended in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) and UNSCEAR
(1993). A DDREF of 2 is also generally compatible with the animal data noted inSection A.4.2. Recognising uncertainties, the Commission recommends that aDDREF of 2 continues to be used for radiological protection purposes.
(A 133) The Commission notes that the BEIR VII Committee (NAS/NRC, 2006)
employed a Bayesian statistical approach to the choice of DDREF based upon a
combination of human data from the LSS and results from appropriately selectedanimal studies. This analysis indicated that DDREF values in the range 1.1–2.3 wereconsistent with these data, and BEIR VII chose a DDREF value of 1.5 for the pur-poses of cancer risk estimation. BEIR VII discusses the elements of subjectivity thatare inherent in choices of DDREF, and the Commission stresses that its recommen-dation to retain an ICRP DDREF summary value of 2 for radiological protectionpurposes is a broad judgement which embodies elements of both subjectivity and
probabilistic uncertainty.
(A 134) Sex averaging. Some radiation-related cancers are sex-speciﬁc and, for
many others, sex is a major modiﬁer of radiation-related risk. In accordance with cur-rent ICRP procedures, intermediate and ﬁnal numerical risk estimates presented hereare sex-averaged. Radiation risks were also calculated by retaining sex speciﬁcity ofintermediate results and sex-averaging only at the ﬁnal stage. The ﬁnal results weresimilar, within acceptable limits, for the two methods of calculation, and sex-speciﬁcdata are not recommended for the general purposes of radiological protection.
(A 135) Transfer of risk between populations. If two populations diﬀer with respect
to prevalence of known modiﬁers of radiation-related risk, their responses to radia-tion exposure might be expected to diﬀer. However, even in the absence of suchinformation, it is problematic to transfer site-speciﬁc estimates of radiation-relatedrisk from one population to the other if the corresponding baseline rates diﬀer.For (an extreme) example, the LSS population provides by far the most usable esti-mates available of radiation-related gastric cancer risk, but age-speciﬁc baseline ratesdiﬀer by a factor of 12 between Japan and the United States. There is rough equiv-
alence between dose-speciﬁc excess absolute risk (EAR
LSS) and the product of excess
relative risk (ERR LSS) and baseline rates for the population of Japan, but the
relationship
EAR LSS¼ERR LSS/C2baseline Japan
corresponds approximately to
EAR LSS¼12/C2ERR LSS/C2baseline USICRP Publication 103
187(A 136) Thus, a multiplicative model estimate of excess risk for stomach cancer in the
US population based on an ERR model, i.e.,
ERR mult¼ERR LSS
is about one twelfth as high as the estimate based on directly transferring the
EAR LSS:
ERR add¼EAR LSS=baseline US¼ERR LSS/C2ðbaseline Japan =baseline USÞ
(A 137) Assuming that ionising radiation exposure acts primarily as a cancer initia-
tor, multiplicative transfer would be plausible if the diﬀerence in population rateswere associated with diﬀerential exposure to cancer promoters, and additive transferwould be plausible if the rate diﬀerence could be ascribed to diﬀerential exposure tocompeting cancer initiators. Given little information about radiation-related stom-
ach cancer risk in the US population, or about modiﬁcation of radiation-related risk
by whatever factors are responsible for the 12-fold diﬀerence between gastric cancerrates in the two countries, it would not be unreasonable to consider all estimates ofthe form
ERR
USðpÞ¼p/C2ERR addþð1/C0pÞ/C2ERR mult
for 06p61, as being equally likely. With this approach, the overall uncertainty is
high, and the mean value, ERR US(1/2), does not really represent the range of (pre-
sumably) equally likely transfer estimates.
(A 138) For most sites, the diﬀerence between Japanese and US rates is consider-
ably less than 12-fold, which means that inability to discriminate between the addi-tive and multiplicative transfer models is less consequential. However, among thesites considered for the present report, only for lung, breast, and thyroid was it con-sidered that there was suﬃcient information to justify a representative value otherthan ERR
US(1/2).
(A 139) Because a pooled analysis of radiation eﬀects on breast cancer risk (Pres-
ton et al., 2002) provides strong evidence against the use of common ERR models,breast cancer risks were based solely on an EAR model, namely that based on theA-bomb data. However, the use of EAR models for predicting thyroid cancer risksis problematic because variation in screening intensity will have a marked eﬀect onthe rate of radiation-associated thyroid cancers. Therefore, thyroid cancer risks werebased solely on the ERR model developed from the pooled analysis of radiation-associated thyroid cancer risks (Ron et al., 1995).
(A 140) Therefore, the population risks were deﬁned as weighted averages of the
additive (absolute) and multiplicative excess risk estimates with weights based onjudgements concerning the relative applicability of the two risk estimates. Weightsof 0.5 were used for all tissues except breast and bone marrow for which only anEAR model was used, thyroid and skin for which only an ERR model was used,and lung for which the ERR model was given a weight of 0.3 because of suggestionsin the atomic bomb survivor data that the EAR is more comparable across sexesthan the ERR, and also that radiation dose and smoking history interact additively
as lung cancer risk factors (Pierce et al., 2003).ICRP Publication 103
188(A 141) Computation of radiation detriment. As in Publication 60 , the detriment for
a tissue, T, is deﬁned as
DT¼ðRF;TþqTRNF ;TÞlT
where RFis the nominal risk of fatal disease, RNFis the nominal risk of non-fatal
disease, qis a non-fatal weight (between 0 and 1) reﬂecting the reduced quality of
life associated with living with a serious illness, and lis the average life lost due to
the disease relative to normal life expectancy, expressed relative to the average overall cancers. As discussed below, the quality of life factor is a function of the lethality(k) of the disease and a subjective judgement accounting for pain, suﬀering, and ad-
verse eﬀects of treatment. Box 1 summarises the steps by which radiation detriment
was calculated for the purposes of developing a system of tissue weighting.
(A 142) Since incidence data are being used here, the nominal risk coeﬃcients are
R
I=RF+RNFand the detriment is computed as
ðkTRI;TþqTð1/C0kTÞRI;TÞlT¼RI;TðkTþqTð1/C0kTÞÞlT
(A 143) The computations in Publication 60 were based on nominal mortality risk
coeﬃcients, RF, and qwas taken to be equal to the lethality fraction k. Thus, the
ICRP Publication 60 cause-speciﬁc detriment is ( RF+k(1/C0k)RF/k)lwhich is equal
toRF(2-k)l(cf pages 134–136 and Table B20 in Publication 60 ), where
RNF¼ð1/C0kÞRF=k:
(A 144) Quality of life detriment. Cancer survivors generally experience adverse
eﬀects on their quality of life. Thus, the Commission judges that cancers should be
weighted not only by lethality but also for pain, suﬀering, and any adverse eﬀectsof cancer treatment. To achieve this, a factor termed q
minis applied to the non-lethal
fractions of cancers to produce an adjusted lethality fraction termed qT. The formula
used to calculate qTwith an adjustment for non-lethal detriment is:
qT¼qminþkTð1/C0qminÞ
where kTis the lethality fraction and qminis the minimum weight for non-lethal
cancers.
(A 145) The value of qminwas set equal to 0.1 (in most instances the result is not
highly sensitive to the value chosen). In eﬀect, the qminadjustment has an impact
upon detriment calculations in proportion to the fraction of cancers that are non-lethal. Accordingly, highly lethal cancers such as lung and stomach cancer are littleaﬀected by q
minwhereas relatively non-lethal cancers such as breast or thyroid are.
For example, if the lethality of a cancer type was 0.30, the adjusted qTwould be
0.37. However, the qminadjustment was not used for skin cancer because radiogenic
skin cancer is almost exclusively of the basal cell type which is usually associatedwith very little pain, suﬀering or treatment sequelae.
(A 146) Lethality adjustment of nominal risk. The nominal risk coeﬃcients are ad-
justed to reﬂect the relative lethality for the cancers (or heritable eﬀects) that occur.Highly lethal cancers receive a relatively greater weight than those that seldom causedeath. The lethality adjustment is given by ( R·q), where Ris the nominal riskICRP Publication 103
189coeﬃcient for a tumour site and qis its lethality fraction, derived from national can-
cer survival data.
(A 147) Relative life lost. Relative years of life lost is an important component of
the detriment computation. Average years of life lost for a given cause was computedfor each sex in each composite population as the average over ages at exposure and
subsequent attained ages of the residual lifetime. The weights were equal to the num-
ber of deaths from the cause of interest in each age group. These were converted torelative values by division by the average years of life lost for all cancers.
(A 148) Table A.4.5 in Section A.4.5 presents the lethality factors, non-fatal case
weights, and relative life lost values used in the current computations. Publication 60
values are shown for comparison.
(A 149) Principal features of new estimates of cancer risk. InPublication 60 the
ERR and EAR models were given equal weights for various tissues, except for
bone marrow. In the present assessment, the relative weights assigned to the
ERR and EAR models were allowed to depart from 50:50 when warranted bythe available data. This made a more realistic model for the inter-country transferof radiogenic breast cancer risks, and largely prevented the potential problem ofthyroid cancer or skin cancer risk estimates being aﬀected by diﬀering degrees ofcancer screening.
(A 150) The present relative detriments (Table A.4.1) are similar to the values cal-
culated in Publication 60 except for four tissue groups: breast, bone marrow, remain-
der tissues and gonads. There appear to be several reasons why the relative detriment
for breast cancer has increased from 0.05 to 0.139. Those exposed as juveniles in theLSS cohort now make a larger contribution to the overall breast cancer risk, whereasthe mortality data used for the Publication 60 analysis only partially reﬂected this
contribution. Furthermore, in the current incidence analyses (Preston et al. 2007),the ERR estimates for women exposed over age 40 years are higher than those usedinPublication 60 . In the 1958–1987 LSS Tumour Registry report on radiation and
solid cancer incidence (Thompson et al. 1994), breast cancers contributed about
11% of the total excess solid cancers as averaged over males and females. In the cur-
rent analyses, breast cancers account for about 18% of the radiation-associated solidcancers. Studies of other exposed populations have conﬁrmed the substantial breastcancer risk from radiation (Preston et al. 2002). On the other hand, the lethality frac-tion for breast cancer has decreased in the past 15 years, probably reﬂecting in-creased early detection and improved treatments, but this appears to have littleimpact on the relative detriment estimates.
(A 151) Improved description of the temporal diminution of leukaemia risk has
contributed to a reduction in the relative detriment for bone marrow from 0.143
to 0.101. The reduction of gonadal risk has already been explained above and per-tains to new information and a revised approach for assessing risks of heritabledisease.
(A 152) The further accumulation of LSS data in the period following Publication
60has signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the ‘remainder tissues’ category. There is now evidence
for excess radiation risk, in the aggregate, among a variety of other tissues, althoughthe degree of risk for any single tissue is unclear. Since the risk in the remainderICRP Publication 103
190category is spread over a large number of tissues and organs, the judgement of the
Commission is that any given tissue should receive a small weight. This judgement
Box A.1. Steps in the development of the tissue weighting system.
The development of the tissue weighting system was based upon relative radia-
tion detriment, primarily for cancer. The sequential steps used were as follows:
a) Determine lifetime cancer incidence risk estimates for radiation-associated
cancers: For 14 organs or tissues, male and female lifetime excess cancerrisks were estimated using both the excess relative risk (ERR) and excessabsolute risk (EAR) models and were then averaged across sexes.
b) Apply a dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF): The lifetime risk
estimates were adjusted downward by a factor of two to account for aDDREF (except for leukaemia, where the linear-quadratic model for risk
already accounts for the DDREF).
c) Transfer risk estimates across populations: To estimate radiation risk for
each cancer site, a weighting of the ERR and EAR lifetime risk estimateswas established that provided a reasonable basis for generalising across pop-ulations with diﬀerent baseline risks. (ERR:EAR weights of 0:100% wereassigned for breast and bone marrow, 100:0% for thyroid and skin,30:70% for lung, and 50:50% for all others).
d) Nominal risk coeﬃcients: These weighted risk estimates, when applied to
and averaged across seven western and Asian populations, provided the
nominal risk coeﬃcients given in Tables A.4.1 and A.4.2.
e) Adjustment for lethality: The lifetime risks for respective cancer sites, which
were based on excess incident cancers, were converted to fatal cancer risksby multiplying by their lethality fractions, as derived from representativenational cancer survival data.
f) Adjustment for quality of life: A further adjustment was applied to account
for the morbidity and suﬀering associated with non-fatal cancers.
g) Adjustment for years of life lost: Since the age distributions of types of can-
cers diﬀer, the average ages of the several types of cancer were estimatedfrom national cancer data and converted to average years of life lost whena cancer occurs. An adjustment for years of life lost was then applied to theresult of the previous steps.
h) Radiation detriment: The results of the calculations above yielded an esti-
mate of the radiation detriment associated with each type of cancer. These,when normalised to sum to unity, constitute the relative radiation detri-
ments in Table A.4.1.
i) Tissue weighting factors: Since the detailed relative radiation detriments in
Table A.4.1 are imprecise because of uncertainties associated with their esti-mation, they were grouped into four categories broadly reﬂecting the rela-tive detriments. A group of residual ‘remainder tissues’ was also added toaccount for radiation risks to organs or tissues for which detailed radia-tion-risk calculations were uninformative.ICRP Publication 103
191is consistent with the LSS and/or other evidence suggesting the risk is probably very
small or that evidence is lacking.
(A 153) In order to provide additional supporting information on factors that
inﬂuence detriment estimates, the Commission computed site-speciﬁc, lethality ad-justed nominal risks and detriment values using various methods. The methods used
were: 1) the current incidence-based estimates; 2) mortality-based computations
using risk models based on the most recent LSS mortality data (Preston et al.2003) applied to the current composite populations together with the current lethal-ity and life lost factors (i.e., the same as (1), but using risk models derived from cur-rent mortality rather than incidence data); 3) mortality-based computations usingPublication 60 ERR models (Table 1, Land and Sinclair 1991) applied to the current
composite populations together with the current lethality and life lost factors (i.e.,the same as (1), but using the Publication 60 relative risk models for mortality in
place of the models based on current incidence data); and 4) the actual Publication
60values.
(A 154) Results of these computations are shown in Table A.4.2. Table A.4.2 also
includes computations of relative detriment based upon application of the BEIR VIImodels (NAS/NRC, 2006) to the combined Euro-American and Asian populationswith an assumed DDREF of 2 (see Table A.4.2 footnote). Parameter estimates forthe risk models used in method 2 are given in Section A.4.5. It can be seen thatthe values of relative detriment using incidence- and mortality-based risk models
(i.e., approaches (1) and (2) above) are generally similar. There are, however, greater
diﬀerences for some tissues in respect of the application of Publication 60 methodol-
ogy to current data (‘Current ICRP 60’) and the speciﬁc published Publication 60
values (‘ICRP 60 actual’). The application of BEIR VII models (NAS/NRC, 2006)shows similar degrees of diﬀerence in relative detriment for some tissues. However,in only a few instances were these diﬀerences greater than a factor of 3, and total det-riment diﬀered by a factor of less than 2.
(A 155) Overall, these comparative calculations suggest that LSS-based central
estimates of radiation cancer risk are reasonably robust and not highly sensitive to
choices of risk models.
(A 156) During the computation of sex-averaged values for detriment based on
cancer incidence and mortality data the Commission was required to compute male-and female-speciﬁc data. These data (Tables A.4.18 and A.4.19 of Section A.4.6) donot contribute speciﬁcally to the formulation of the ICRP tissue weighting schemeas summarised in Box A.1, but can act to inform other related judgements. It isemphasised that these sex-speciﬁc data have limited utility because the Commis-
sion’s estimates of nominal risk relate to a nominal population of females and males
with typical age distributions and are computed by averaging over age groups andsex; the dosimetric quantity, eﬀective dose, is also computed by age- and sex-averaging.
(A 157) The use of relative detriment from incidence data for a tissue weighting sys-
tem. The Commission has made a policy decision that there should be a single set of
w
Tvalues that are averaged over both sexes and all ages.ICRP Publication 103
192(A 158) However, whilst adhering to this policy, the Commission fully recognises
that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in risk between males and females (particularlyfor the breast) and in respect of age at exposure.
(A 159) A set of w
Tvalues could be proposed that closely follows the respective
values of relative detriment based on incidence data given in Table A.4.1 together
with the supporting comparative data of Table A.4.2. However, the Commission
feels that additional judgements need to be exercised to include subjective factors,not reﬂected in the mathematical formulation of detriment. In particular, the follow-ing judgements were applied:

/C15The detriment of thyroid cancer was set at 0.04 to take account of the concentra-
tion of cancer risk in childhood, i.e., young children are considered to be a partic-ularly sensitive subgroup.
/C15Cancer risk in salivary glands and brain, whilst not speciﬁcally quantiﬁable, isjudged to be greater than that of other tissues in the remainder fraction and,
for this reason, each is ascribed a w
Tof 0.01.
(A 160) Re-ordering of wTvalues using the above judgements was made ensuring
that these values did not diverge from the relative detriments of Table A.4.1 by morethan around two-fold. This reassignment gives a w
Tvalue for the remainder tissues
of 0.12. The Commission presents a new proposal on the way in which the weighting
of remainder tissues is treated.
(A 161) According to this proposal the wTfor remainder tissues (0.12) is divided
equally between the 14 tissues given in the footnote to Table A.4.3, 0.0086 each,which is lower than the w
Tfor the lowest of the named tissues (0.01). The low cancer
risk in connective tissues is taken into account through its contribution to cancer inthe named organs speciﬁed in Table A.4.3. Cancer risk in adipose tissue is judged tobe insigniﬁcant and, for this reason, it has not been included in remainder tissues.
The number of tissues included in remainder could be increased if necessary. The sys-
tem preserves additivity in eﬀective doses. This is judged to be an appropriate sim-pliﬁcation of the scheme of Publication 60 in which the w
Tfor the remainder is
divided among the ﬁve remainder tissues which receive the highest dose, i.e., anon-additive system. Mass weighting of tissues in the remainder fraction was ex-plored but rejected. The principal reason for this rejection was that the very large dis-parities in tissue masses caused unacceptable distortions of eﬀective dose for certainradionuclides.
(A 162) On the basis of the detriment data of Tables A.4.1 and A.4.2, plus the
judgements summarised above, the Commission proposes the tissue weightingscheme given in Table A.4.3. This scheme which seeks to generally represent tis-sue-speciﬁc radiation detriment is, of necessity, imprecise. In particular, for theremainder tissues there is little or no epidemiological evidence of radiation-associatedcancer for individual tissues, and their inclusion is largely a prudent measure. TheCommission also emphasises that w

193Nominal risk coeﬃcients for cancer and heritable eﬀects
(A 163) New data on the risks of radiation-induced cancer and heritable eﬀects
have been used by the Commission in risk modelling and disease detriment calcula-tions in order to estimate nominal risk coeﬃcients.
(A 164) On the basis of these calculations (Table A.4.1) the Commission proposes
nominal risk coeﬃcients for lethality-adjusted cancer risk as 5.5 10
/C02Sv/C01for the
whole population and 4.1 10/C02Sv/C01for adult workers aged 18–64. For heritable ef-
fects, the lethality-adjusted nominal risk in the whole population is estimated as 0.210
/C02Sv/C01and in adult workers as 0.1 10/C02Sv/C01. These estimates are shown in Table
A.4.4, where they are compared with the estimates of detriment used in the 1990 Rec-ommendations of ICRP Publication 60 . These estimates are intended to apply only to
populations and are not recommended for use in estimating risks in individuals orsubgroups.
(A 165) In respect of Table A.4.4 it is important to note that the detriment-ad-
justed nominal risk coeﬃcient for cancer estimated here has been computed in a dif-ferent manner from that of Publication 60 . The present estimate is based upon
lethality/life-impairment-weighted data on cancer incidence with adjustment for rel-ative life lost, whereas in Publication 60 detriment was based upon fatal cancer risk
weighted for non-fatal cancer, relative life lost for fatal cancers and life impairmentfor non-fatal cancer. In this respect it is also notable that the detriment-unadjustednominal risk coeﬃcient for fatal cancer in the whole population that may be pro-
jected from the cancer incidence-based data of Table A.4.1a is around 4% per Sv
as compared with the Publication 60 value of 5% per Sv. The corresponding value
using cancer mortality-based models is essentially unchanged at around 5% per Sv.
(A 166) An additional point relating to the present detriment-adjusted cancer coef-
ﬁcients of Table A.4.4 is that, during the period that the present ICRP Recommen-dations are likely to apply, the survival rates for many cancers are expected to rise. Inthis respect the nominal risk coeﬃcient proposed here will tend to be an overestimateof risks in the future.
(A 167) The diﬀerences in the estimates of detriment-adjusted heritable eﬀects be-
tween the present report and Publication 60 are explained and discussed in Section
A.6.5.
Cancer risk following prenatal (in-utero) irradiation
(A 168) Studies on cancer risk following irradiation of the unborn child were
reviewed in Publication 90 (ICRP 2003a).
(A 169) The largest case-control study of cancer after in-utero irradiation, the Ox-
ford Study of Childhood Cancers (OSCC), found that radiation increased all types of
childhood cancer by approximately the same degree. The second largest study showeda larger relative risk of leukaemia than for solid tumours, while several cohorts studiesof in-utero radiation found no clear evidence of radiation-induced childhood cancer.The limited data from the atomic bomb survivors suggest that the lifetime cancer riskfrom in-utero exposure may be similar to that from exposure in early childhood.
(A 170) The OSCC data suggest that cancer induction is at least as likely following
exposure in the ﬁrst trimester as in later trimesters. From the data published to date,ICRP Publication 103
194it is not possible to determine tissue-weighting factors in order to deﬁne cancer risk
in diﬀerent tissues and organs. Adequate human in-utero exposure data are notavailable to deﬁne the dose and dose-rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) for low-LET radiation or the RBE values for neutron or other high-LET radiations.
(A 171) Given the limitations of the available data, the Commission has not
attempted to derive a speciﬁc value for the nominal coeﬃcient for life-time cancer
risk after prenatal exposure, and supports the Publication 90 (ICRP, 2003a) judge-
ment that it is reasonable to assume that this risk is, at most, a few times that ofthe population as a whole. This in-utero risk is judged to be no greater than thatfollowing exposure in early childhood.
Genetic susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer
(A 172) On the basis of the data analyses and judgements developed in Publication
79(ICRP, 1998a) and further information reviewed by UNSCEAR (2000), UNSCE-
AR (2001), and the BEIR VII Committee (NAS/NRC, 2006), the Commission be-lieves that strongly expressing, high penetrance, cancer genes are too rare to causesigniﬁcant distortion of the population-based estimates of low-dose radiation cancerrisk made in this Section of the report. However, as noted in Publication 79 , there are
likely to be implications for individual cancer risks, particularly for second cancers ingene carriers receiving radiotherapy for a ﬁrst neoplasm. Although the Commissionrecognises that weakly expressing variant cancer genes may, in principle, be suﬃ-
ciently common to impact upon population-based estimates of radiation cancer risk,
the information available is not suﬃcient to provide a meaningful quantitative judge-ment on this issue.
The possibility of non-linear low-dose responses for cancer risk
(A 173) The emergence of new data and hypotheses frequently poses questions on
the validity of scientiﬁc hypotheses and their practical applications. This is certainlythe case in radiological protection and particularly for the so-called linear-non-
threshold (LNT) model and the derived LNT model used for projecting cancer risk
to low doses and low dose rates (UNSCEAR, 2000, CERRIE, 2004, NAS/NRC,2006, French Academies Report 2005). As given below, there are two principal cat-egories of challenge, both of which hypothesise non-linear low-dose responses.
(A 174) Supra-linear low-dose responses. It has been proposed by some that the
radiation dose response for cancer induction has a supra-linear component at lowdoses (i.e., a bimodal dose-response relationship) and therefore the projection oflow-dose risk from observations made at higher doses will lead to a substantial
underestimate of the true risk (CERRIE 2004 and references therein). Such hypoth-
eses are frequently cited in association with reports on unusual epidemiological andexperimental observations.
(A 175) The UK CERRIE Committee (CERRIE 2004) considered the scientiﬁc
validity of claims of such underestimation of cancer risk, particularly in respect ofinternal radiations. The claims considered were largely based upon; a) the interpre-tation of selected epidemiological datasets; b) biophysical proposals on the mode ofaction of certain internal radiations; c) the role of induced genomic instability/ICRP Publication 103
195bystander signalling in cancer development; and d) the ﬁtting of bimodal or polymo-
dal dose-responses to epidemiological and experimental data.
(A 176) The Commission agrees with the general view expressed by the majority of
CERRIE members that none of the proposals on the gross underestimation of riskthat were considered have a sound scientiﬁc basis and that some are demonstrably
ﬂawed. The following points illustrate the views of the Commission:
/C15The epidemiological evidence cited did not provide consistent evidence that risk of
childhood leukaemia from nuclear test fallout was seriously underestimated byestablished radiation risk models.
/C15The so-called Second Event Theory cited in support of higher than expectedcancer risk from
90Sr and particulate forms of alpha-emitters was inadequately
formulated and inconsistent with a well-established body of biological data.
/C15The association between induced genomic instability/bystander signalling and
cancer risk has yet to be established adequately (see Section A.4.1, paragraphA 97).
/C15The data relating to bimodal/polymodal dose responses were generally weak, thestatistical analyses were inadequate, and the phenomena, if real, had no obviousmechanistic basis.
(A 177) While recognising considerable uncertainty on estimates of cancer risk at
low doses, the Commission judges that the data and theories concerning supra-lineardose response do not provide evidence that the application of current cancer riskmodels based upon the linear-non-threshold (LNT) model and application of theconcept of eﬀective dose leads to a gross underestimate of cancer risk.

196(A 178) Dose thresholds. In the preceding discussion and computations it has been
assumed that, at low doses and at low dose rates, site-speciﬁc cancer risk from low-LET radiation is proportional to radiation dose, consistent with the LNT model.Thus, the possibility that there might be a threshold dose, below which there wouldbe no radiation-related cancer risk, has been ignored. The LNT model is not univer-
sally accepted as biological truth, but rather, because we do not actually know what
level of risk is associated with very-low-dose exposure, it is considered to be a pru-dent judgement for public policy aimed at avoiding unnecessary risk from exposure.
(A 179) As discussed at length in Publication 99 (ICRP, 2005d), the LNT model
receives considerable, although not decisive, support from epidemiological studiesof radiation-related cancer risk, in the sense that the risk of mortality and morbidityfrom all solid cancers combined in the LSS is proportional to radiation dose down toabout 100 mGy, below which statistical variation in baseline risk, as well as small
and uncontrollable biases, increasingly tend to obscure evidence concerning any
radiation-related risk. This uncertainty is the main reason why it is generally impos-sible to determine, on epidemiological grounds alone, that there is, or is not, an in-creased risk of cancer associated with radiation exposures of the order of a few tens

mathematical models that assume a simple relationship, e.g., linear, linear-quadratic,or linear with a dose and dose rate eﬀectiveness factor (DDREF) between risk athigher doses, where epidemiological data tend to be informative, and at doses solow that direct epidemiological observation is uninformative.
(A 180) In spite of the biological evidence supporting the LNT model with respect
to the induction by ionising radiation of complex DNA damage, for which repairmechanisms in mammalian species tend to be error-prone, the possibility of a thresh-old for cancer induction at some unknown low dose cannot be ruled out (see SectionA.4.1).
(A 181) At the molecular level, the generation of multiple DNA lesions within
close spatial proximity, creating complex damage for which mammalian repairmechanisms tend to be error-prone, is believed to be the primary mechanism by
which ionising radiation contributes to the induction of mutations and chromosome
aberrations and hence to the pathogenesis of cancer. Such clustered damage in DNA

198can, in principle, be induced even by a single radiation track through a cell. Also,
while many of the viable cells containing such radiation-induced damage may beeliminated by damage response pathways involving cell cycle checkpoint controland apoptotic cell death, it is clear from analysis of cytogenetic and mutation datathat damaged or altered cells are capable of evading these protective measures and
propagating.
(A 182) Recent studies using newly developed animal models of radiation tumor-
igenesis support the view that the essential radiation-associated events in the tumor-igenic process are predominantly early events involving DNA losses targetingspeciﬁc genomic regions harbouring critical genes (see Section A.2.7, paragraphsA 41 – A 44). As such, the response for early initiating events is likely to correspondto that for the induction of cytogenetic and mutagenic damage. On this basis, mech-anistic arguments support a linear response in the low-dose region, i.e., the process
should be independent of dose rate because interactions between diﬀerent electron
tracks should be rare. Quantitative analyses of dose responses for tumorigenesisand for life shortening in laboratory animals also tend to support this predictionalbeit with considerable quantitative uncertainty.
(A 183) There are also long-standing arguments on whether some form of low-
dose stimulation of anti-tumorigenic components of the immune system might serveto reduce cancer risk. Such proposals have been considered in depth by UNSCEAR(UNSCEAR 1993, 1994), and the Commission shares the doubts of UNSCEAR that

199the immune system plays a signiﬁcant role in any cancer-related adaptive processes
at low doses (UNSCEAR 2000).
(A 184) As discussed in Publication 99 , the statistical uncertainty highlighted ear-
lier in this section is accompanied by other uncertainties, on the model assumptionsneeded to estimate the risk of radiation-related cancer at low radiation doses. These
latter uncertainties are usually subject to only subjective quantiﬁcation. Such uncer-
tain assumptions include, among others, the DDREF to be applied at low doses andlow dose rates, the relationship between excess and baseline cancer rates when trans-ferring estimates from one population to another, and the relationship between esti-mated and true radiation dose in the exposed population from which the riskestimate was derived (see paragraphs A 125–A 148). All of these assumptions canprofoundly aﬀect the estimated risk and its probabilistic uncertainty limits. If onealso allows for the uncertain possibility of a universal threshold dose at some known
level, or a threshold the value of which is highly uncertain or which varies widely
among members of the exposed population, this also aﬀects the risk estimate andits uncertainty limits. In an analysis described in Publication 99 it was found that, un-
less the existence of a threshold was assumed to be virtually certain, and its possiblevalues restricted well beyond that which can be justiﬁed on current knowledge, theeﬀect of introducing the uncertain possibility of a threshold was equivalent to that

208of an uncertain increase in the value of DDREF, i.e., merely a variation on the result
obtained by ignoring the possibility of a threshold.
(A 185) The existence of a low-dose threshold for cancer induction in certain tis-
sues is not implausible. Indeed, as noted in Publication 99 there is no clear evidence
for a radiation-associated excess of cancers for a number of human tissues, e.g.,
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, testicular cancer, and melanoma skin cancer.

209(A 186) Although the available data do not exclude the existence of a universal
low-dose threshold, the evidence as a whole, as interpreted and summarised in thisAnnex, does not favour this proposition. The BEIR VII Committee (NAS/NRC,2006) has recently published a report on low-dose risk that essentially arrives atthe same conclusion based on epidemiological and biological data.

aEstimates based on cancer incidence data.ICRP Publication 103
210equally recent low-dose report from the French Academies (2005) emphasises
evidence on the potential dose-dependence of post-irradiation cellular signalling,DNA repair, apoptosis and other adaptive anti-tumorigenic processes in order toargue for the existence of a practical low-dose threshold for radiation cancer risk.Overall, the long standing question on the true validity of the LNT model may well
prove to be beyond deﬁnitive scientiﬁc resolution and that ‘weight of evidence’ argu-
ments and practical judgements are likely to continue to apply in the foreseeablefuture.
(A 187) In summary, the Commission judges that there are at present no good sci-
entiﬁc reasons to include the possibilities of supra-linear dose responses or of a low-dose threshold in cancer risk calculations for the purposes of radiological protection.On this basis it is recommended that the LNT model, combined with a judged valueof DDREF for extrapolation from high doses, remains a prudent basis for the prac-
tical purposes of radiological protection at low doses and low dose rates.
A.4.5. Further details of the detriment calculations
(A 188) In this Section, the model parameters used for the Commission’s risk mod-
el are provided in detail. Table A.4.5 lists the lethality factors, non-fatal case weights,and relative life lost for the various sites considered. Tables A.4.6 and A.4.7 showcoeﬃcients in the current cancer incidence-based ERR and EAR models, respec-
tively, while Tables A.4.8 and A.4.9 show coeﬃcients in the current cancer mortal-
ity-based ERR and EAR models. Female and male Euro-American cancerincidence rates by age and site are given in Tables A.4.10 and A.4.11, and femaleand male Euro-American cancer mortality rates are given in Tables A.4.12 andA.4.13. Tables A.4.14 and A.4.15 show Asian female and male cancer incidencerates, and Tables A.4.16 and A.4.17 provide Asian female and male cancer mortalityrates.
A.4.6. Estimates of sex-speciﬁc population detriments
(A 189) This Section provides estimates of sex-speciﬁc detriments, based on cancer
incidence data, for ages 0–85 years at exposure in Table A.4.18 and for ages 18–64years at exposure in Table A.4.19. The Commission emphasises that these sex-spe-ciﬁc values for detriment have no speciﬁc function in its system of radiological pro-tection (see paragraph A 156).

213A.5. Non-cancer diseases after radiation exposure
(A 190) Since 1990 evidence has accumulated that the frequency of non-cancer dis-
eases is increased in irradiated populations. The strongest evidence for the inductionof these non-cancer eﬀects at doses of the order of 1 Sv derives from the A-bomb
LSS, and the most recent mortality analysis (Preston et al., 2003) has strengthened
the statistical evidence for an association with dose – particularly for heart disease,stroke, digestive disorders and respiratory disease. However, the Commission notescurrent uncertainties on the shape of the dose response at low doses and that theLSS data are consistent both with there being no dose threshold for risks of diseasemortality and with a threshold of around 0.5 Sv. It is unclear what forms of cellular/tissue mechanisms might underlie such a diverse set of non-cancer disorders reportedamong the LSS data although some association with subclinical inﬂammation (e.g.,
Hayashi et al., 2003) is possible.
(A 191) Additional evidence of the non-cancer eﬀects of radiation, albeit at high
doses, comes from studies of cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Studies of pa-tients treated for Hodgkin’s disease (e.g., Hancock et al. 1993, Aleman et al. 2003)and for breast cancer (e.g., Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group2000) have shown raised risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease, associatedwith doses of several tens of Gy. The situation at lower doses is less clear. A reviewof published epidemiological data of groups with medical or occupational exposures,
which compared the rates of circulatory disease in irradiated and non-irradiated
individuals drawn from the same population, concluded that there was no clear evi-dence of an increased risk in the majority of studies over the dose range 0 to 4 Sv(McGale and Darby 2005). Interpretation of many studies was, however, compli-cated by the very limited dose response data available and by a lack of informationon possible confounding factors such as smoking.
(A 192) Whilst recognising the potential importance of these observations on non-
cancer diseases, the Commission judges that the data available do not allow for their
inclusion in the estimation of detriment following radiation doses in the range up to
around 100 mSv. This agrees with the conclusion of UNSCEAR (2008), which foundlittle evidence of any excess risk below 0.5 Sv.

216ICRP Publication 103A.6. Risks of heritable diseases
A.6.1. Introduction
(A 193) The term ‘genetic risks’ as used in this document denotes the probability
of harmful genetic eﬀects manifest in the descendants of a population that has sus-
tained radiation exposures. These eﬀects are expressed as increases over the baselinefrequencies of genetic diseases in the population per unit dose of low-LET, low-dose/chronic irradiation.
(A 194) Since the publication of the 1990 Recommendations of the ICRP (ICRP,
1991b), the 1990 BEIR report (NRC, 1990), and the UNSCEAR (1993) report, sev-eral important advances have been made in the prediction of genetic risks of expo-sure of human populations to ionising radiation. On the basis of these, UNSCEAR
(2001) revised its earlier risk estimates. The aim of this section of the report is to pro-
vide a brief background on the available information and the methods that are usedfor risk estimation, to summarise the recent advances, to present the revised risk esti-mates, and to indicate how the new estimates can be used to derive a risk coeﬃcientfor genetic eﬀects.
A.6.2. Background information
Naturally occurring genetic diseases
(A 195) The genetic diseases of interest in the present context are those due to
mutations in single genes (Mendelian diseases) and those which are due to multiplegenetic and environmental factors (multifactorial diseases). Historically, UNSCE-AR, the BEIR Committees, and ICRP had also considered an additional class ofgenetic diseases, namely, chromosomal diseases which are due to gross structuraland numerical abnormalities of chromosomes.
(A 196) Mendelian diseases are further subdivided into autosomal dominant, auto-
somal recessive, and X-linked recessive categories depending on the chromosomal
location (autosomes or the X-chromosome) of the mutant genes and their transmis-sion patterns. In the case of an autosomal dominant disease, a single mutant geneinherited from either parent (i.e., in a heterozygous state) is suﬃcient to cause disease(e.g., achondroplasia, neuroﬁbromatosis, Marfan syndrome, etc.). The somewhatunusual genetics of dominantly inherited cancer predisposition are discussed in Pub-
lication 79 (ICRP, 1998a). Autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two mu-
tant genes, one from each parent, at the same locus (i.e., homozygosity) for
disease manifestation (e.g., cystic ﬁbrosis, haemochromatosis, Bloom syndrome,
ataxia telangiectasia, etc.). In the case of X-linked recessive diseases, since males haveonly one X-chromosome, usually only males are aﬀected (e.g., haemophilia, Duch-enne muscular dystrophy, Fabry disease, etc.). However, some X-linked dominantdiseases are also known (e.g., Rett syndrome), but, for the purpose of the presentdocument, they are included under X-linked recessive diseases. The important gen-eral point with respect to Mendelian diseases is that the relationship between muta-tion and disease is simple and predictable.ICRP Publication 103
217(A 197) Multifactorial diseases are aetiologically complex and consequently the
relationship between mutation and disease is also complex, i.e., these do not showMendelian patterns of inheritance. The two subgroups that constitute multifactorialdiseases are the common congenital abnormalities (e.g., neural tube defects, cleft lipwith or without cleft palate, congenital heart defects, etc.) and chronic diseases of
adults (e.g., coronary heart disease, essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc.).
Evidence for a genetic component in their aetiology comes from family and twinstudies which show that the ﬁrst-degree relatives of aﬀected individuals have a higherrisk of disease than matched controls. For most of them, knowledge of the genes in-volved, the types of mutational alterations, and the nature of environmental factorsstill remains limited. Among the models used to explain the inheritance patterns ofmultifactorial diseases and estimate recurrence risks in relatives is the multifactorialthreshold model (MTM) of disease liability. This is considered in a later section.
(A 198) Chromosomal diseases arise as a result of gross numerical (e.g., Down
syndrome due to trisomy for chromosome 21) or structural abnormalities of chro-mosomes (e.g., Cri du chat syndrome due to deletion of part or whole short armof chromosome 5) generally detectable in cytological preparations of cells. This isreally not an aetiological category and, further, deletions (microscopically detectableor not) are now known to contribute to a number of genetic diseases grouped underautosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked diseases.
The doubling dose method
(A 199) In the absence of human data on radiation-induced genetic diseases, all
the methods that have been developed and used since the mid 1950s up to the presentare indirect; their aim is to make the best use of mutation data obtained in radiationstudies with mice, data on baseline frequencies of genetic diseases in the population,and population genetic theory, to predict the radiation risk of genetic diseases inhumans. One such method that has been used from the early 1970s onwards untilnow (e.g., UNSCEAR 2001) is the doubling dose method. This method enables
one to express the expected increase in the frequencies of genetic diseases in terms
of their baseline frequencies using the following equation:
Risk per unit dose ¼P/C2½1=DD/C138/C2MC ðA:6:1Þ
where P is the baseline frequency of the genetic disease class under study, DD is the
doubling dose (and [1/DD] is the relative mutation risk per unit dose), and MC is thedisease-class-speciﬁc mutation component.
(A 200) The genetic theory that underlies the use of the DD method for risk esti-
mation is what is referred to as the equilibrium theory which population geneticistsuse to explain the dynamics of mutant genes in populations. The theory postulatesthat the stability of mutant gene frequencies (and thus of disease frequencies) in apopulation is the result of the existence of a balance between the rate at which spon-taneous mutations enter the gene pool of the population in every generation and therate at which they are eliminated by natural selection, i.e., through failure of survivalor reproduction. Under normal conditions (i.e., in the absence of radiation expo-ICRP Publication 103
218sures), the population is assumed to be in equilibrium between mutation and
selection.
(A 201) When the mutation rate is increased as a result of radiation, say, in every
generation, the balance between mutation and selection is disturbed by the inﬂux ofinduced mutations, but the prediction is that the population will eventually attain a
new equilibrium (over a number of generations) between mutation and selection.
The amount of increase in mutation frequency, the time it takes for the populationto reach the new equilibrium, and the rate of approach to it are all dependent oninduced mutation rates, the intensity of selection, the type of genetic disease, andwhether radiation exposure occurs in one generation only or generation after gener-ation. Worth mentioning here is that, since the starting population (before radiationexposure) is assumed to be in equilibrium between mutation and selection, the quan-tity P in Eqn. (A.6.1) represents the equilibrium incidence.
(A 202) Doubling dose . The doubling dose (DD) is the amount of radiation that is
required to produce as many mutations as those that arise spontaneously in a gen-eration. Ideally, it is estimated as a ratio of the average rates of spontaneous and in-duced mutations in a given set of genes.
(A 203) The reciprocal of the DD (i.e., [1/DD]) is the relative mutation risk (RMR)
per unit dose. Since RMR is a fraction, the smaller the DD, the higher is the RMRand vice versa.
(A 204) Mutation component . Formally deﬁned, mutation component (MC) is the
relative increase in disease frequency per unit relative increase in mutation rate:
MC¼½DP=P/C138=½Dm=m/C138ð A:6:2Þ
where Pis the baseline disease frequency, DPits change due to Dmchange in muta-
tion rate, and mthe spontaneous mutation rate. The procedures used for estimating
MC are relatively straightforward for autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases,slightly complicated for autosomal recessives (since an induced recessive mutation
does not precipitate a recessive disease in the immediate post-radiation generations)
and more complex for multifactorial diseases, and depends on the model that is usedto explain their stable frequencies in the population.
A.6.3. Recent advances in understanding
(A 205) The advances that have been made during the past few years include: a) an
upward revision of the estimates of the baseline frequencies of Mendelian diseases;
b) the introduction of a conceptual change in the calculation of the DD; c) the elab-
oration of methods for estimating MC for Mendelian and chronic diseases; d) theintroduction of an additional factor called the ‘potential recoverability correctionfactor’ (PRCF) in the risk equation to bridge the gap between the rates of radia-tion-induced mutations in mice and the risk of radiation-inducible genetic diseasein human live births; and e) the introduction of the concept that the adverse eﬀectsof radiation-induced genetic damage in humans are likely to be manifest predomi-nantly as multisystem developmental abnormalities in the progeny. All these have
been discussed in detail in a series of recent publications (Chakraborty et al. 1998,ICRP Publication 103
219Denniston et al. 1998, Sankaranarayanan 1998, 1999, Sankaranarayanan and Cha-
kraborty 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, Sankaranarayanan et al. 1994, 1999, NAS/NRC2006). Box 2 summarises the procedures used by the Commission to estimate radia-tion risk for heritable disease which take account of these advances in understanding.
Baseline frequencies of genetic diseases
(A 206) Until the 1993 UNSCEAR report, the baseline frequencies used in risk
estimation were based on those compiled by Carter (1977) for Mendelian diseases,by UNSCEAR (1977) for chromosomal diseases, by Czeizel and Sankaranarayanan(1984) for congenital abnormalities, and by Czeizel et al. (1988) for chronic diseases.While the estimates for the last three groups of diseases have remained unchanged,those for Mendelian diseases have now been revised upwards (Sankaranarayanan,1998). Both the earlier and the current estimates (the latter used in UNSCEAR,
2001) are presented in Table A.6.1.
The doubling dose
(A 207) A re-examination of the assumptions involved in using the DD based on
mouse data for risk estimation. The DD used until the 1993 UNSCEAR report
was 1 Gy (for chronic, low-LET radiation conditions) and was based entirely onmouse data on spontaneous and induced rates of recessive mutations in seven genes.Box A.2. Steps in estimating radiation risk for heritable diseases.
a) Establish the baseline frequencies of human genetic diseases of all classes
(a set of values of P).
b) Estimate average spontaneous mutation rate per generation for human
genes.
c) No human data available, so estimate average rate of radiation-induced
mutations in mice – assume that mouse rates are similar to those ofhumans.
d) From b) and c) above, estimate the genetic doubling dose (DD). DD is the
radiation dose required to produce as many mutations as those that arisespontaneously in one generation.
e) Estimate the mutation component (MC) for diﬀerent classes of genetic dis-
eases. MC is a relative measure of the relationship between change in
mutation rate and increase in disease frequency.
f) Estimate the potential recoverability correction factor (PRCF) for diﬀer-
ent classes of mutation. PRCF allows for diﬀering degrees of recoverabil-ity of mutations in live births, i.e., the fraction of mutations that iscompatible with embryonic/fetal development.
g) For each class of human genetic disease complete the following equation
using the estimates from a) to f) above.
Risk per unit dose ¼P/C2½1=DD/C138/C2MC/C2PCRFICRP Publication 103
220One of the assumptions underlying the use of mouse-data-based DD for risk estima-
tion is that both the spontaneous and induced mutation rates in mice and humansare the same. The assumption regarding induced rates of mutations, while unavoid-able, is defensible on the grounds of generally similar gene organisation, 70–90%homology in DNA sequence of genes, and substantial conservation of synteny formany (although not all) chromosomal regions in both the species. However, the sit-uation is diﬀerent with respect to spontaneous mutation rates.
(A 208) Arguments supporting the view that the spontaneous mutation rates in
mice and humans are unlikely to be similar have been discussed (Sankaranarayanan,
1998, Sankaranarayanan and Chakraborty, 2000a, UNSCEAR, 2001). Brieﬂy, un-like in the mouse, in humans there are pronounced sex-diﬀerences in spontaneousmutation rates (being higher in males than in females), and the mutation rate in-creases with the age of the father (paternal age eﬀect). These diﬀerences when con-sidered along with the fact that the human lifespan is longer than that of themouse, suggest that extrapolating from the short-lived mouse to humans is unlikelyto provide a reliable average spontaneous rate in a heterogeneous human population
of all ages. Additionally, recent analyses of mouse data on mutations that arise as
germinal mosaics (which result in clusters of identical mutations in the followinggeneration) have introduced considerable uncertainty about the spontaneous muta-tion rate in the mouse (Selby, 1998).
(A 209) The use of human data on spontaneous mutation rates and mouse data for
induced mutation rates for DD calculations. In view of the reasons stated in the preced-
ing paragraphs, UNSCEAR (2001) considered it prudent to base DD calculations onhuman data on spontaneous mutation rates, and mouse data on induced mutation
rates, as was ﬁrst done in the 1972 BEIR report (NRC 1972). The advantages of using
human data in DD calculations are: a) they pertain to human disease-causing genes;b) the mutation rate estimates in humans, because they are averaged over the sexes,automatically include paternal age eﬀects; and c) in estimating mutation rates, humangeneticists count all mutations irrespective of whether they are part of a cluster or not;consequently, had clusters occurred, they would have been included.Table A.6.1.

221(A 210) Average spontaneous mutation rate for human genes. For calculating an
average spontaneous mutation rate for human genes, UNSCEAR (2001) focusedon published data on those genes for which estimates of selection coeﬃcient( s) were
also available, the reason being that selection coeﬃcients are relevant for estimatingMC (to be discussed in the next section). Further, only autosomal dominant diseases,
but not X-linked ones, were included in the analysis, the rationale being that: a)
among Mendelian diseases, autosomal dominants constitute the most importantgroup from the standpoint of genetic risks; b) while X-linked diseases are also ex-pected to respond directly to an increase in mutation rate, their incidence in the pop-ulation is an order of magnitude lower than that of autosomal dominants (0.15%versus 1.50%); and, consequently, c) the assumption of similar average mutationrates for these two classes of disease in the context of risk estimation is unlikely toresult in an underestimate of the risk.
(A 211) The average (unweighted) spontaneous mutation rate based on a total of
26 autosomal dominant disease phenotypes (which, on current knowledge, relate tomutations in an estimated 135 genes) was (2.95 ± 0.64) 10
/C06gene/C01generation/C01
(Sankaranarayanan and Chakraborty 2000a). This estimate is well within the range
of 0.5 10/C05to 0.5 10/C06per gene assumed in the 1972 BEIR report (NRC 1972). The
data used for spontaneous mutation rate calculations also permit an estimate of0.294 for average selection coeﬃcient(s) associated with these diseases.
(A 212) Average rate of induced mutations in mice. As mentioned earlier, until the
1993 UNSCEAR report, the average rate of induced mutations used in DD calcula-
tions was based on data from studies of recessive speciﬁc locus mutations in sevengenes. In the 2001 report, however, UNSCEAR expanded the database to includenot only the above, but also data from studies of enzyme activity mutations, as wellas dominant mutations at four loci ( Sl,W,SpandT). All these data come from stud-
ies of males in which the irradiated germ cell stages were stem-cell spermatogonia(the relevant germ cell stages in males from the standpoint of risks). The data fromstudies with female mice were not used since, as discussed in the 1988 UNSCEAR
report, there is uncertainty as to whether the mouse immature oocytes (with nearly
zero sensitivity to mutation induction after acute as well as chronic irradiation)would provide a good model for assessing the mutational radiosensitivity of humanimmature oocytes that are the relevant germ cell stages in the females. For the pur-pose of risk estimation, to err on the side of caution, it was assumed that the inducedrates in females will be the same as those in males.
(A 213) Details of the data used are discussed in the UNSCEAR, 2001 report and
by Sankaranarayanan and Chakraborty (2000a). The average induced mutation rate,
based on mutations recovered at a total of 34 mouse genes, is (1.08 ± 0.30) 10
/C05
gene/C01Gy/C01for acute X or cirradiation. With a dose-rate reduction factor of 3 tra-
ditionally used, the rate for chronic irradiation conditions becomes (0.36 ± 0.10)10
/C05gene/C01Gy/C01.
(A 214) The doubling dose. With the revised estimates for average spontaneous
mutation rate (2.95 ± 0.64) 10/C06gene/C01generation/C01for human genes and for aver-
age rate of induced mutations (0.36 ± 0.10) 10/C05gene/C01Gy/C01for mouse genes, theICRP Publication 103
222new DD becomes (0.82 ± 0.29) Gy. This estimate, however, is not very diﬀerent from
1 Gy that has been used thus far but which was based entirely on mouse data.
(A 215) UNSCEAR (2001) has suggested the continued use of the 1 Gy estimate in
order to avoid the impression of undue precision, but noting that a conceptualchange has now been made (i.e., use of human data on spontaneous and mouse data
on induced mutation rates) and that the present estimate is supported by more exten-
sive data than had been the case thus far. The Commission supports the UNSCEARjudgement and therefore ICRP retains a DD value of 1 Gy.
Mutation component
(A 216) As noted in Section A.6.2, the quantity ‘mutation component’ (MC) used
in Eqn. (A.6.1) provides a measure of the relative change in disease frequency perunit relative change in mutation rate for the diﬀerent classes of genetic diseases.
The elements of the basic MC concept were introduced already in the 1972 BEIR
report (NRC, 1972) and were subsequently considered in the papers of Crow andDenniston (1981, 1985). Within the framework of an ICRP Task Group, set up in1993, the problem was studied in detail, and the concept, theory, methods for esti-mation, and algebraic formulations were fully elaborated for both Mendelian andmultifactorial diseases. The Task Group report has since been published ( Publication
83, ICRP, 1999b). The methods developed in that document now enable the evalu-
ation of the magnitude of the MC for any post-radiation generation of interest, after
either a one-time or a permanent increase in mutation rate, i.e., radiation exposure in
every generation. In what follows, a brief summary of the main ﬁndings is presented.
(A 217) Mutation component for autosomal dominant diseases. For autosomal
dominant diseases (for which the relationship between mutation and disease isstraightforward) the estimation procedure is relatively simple. For a one-generationradiation exposure which produces a one-time increase in mutation rate (‘burst’,indicated by the subscript ‘b’ in MC
bbelow), the change with time ‘t’ (in generations)
is given by the equation:
MC bðtÞ¼sð1/C0sÞt/C01ðA:6:3Þ
For radiation exposure to many successive generations producing a permanent in-
crease in mutation rate (indicated by the subscript ‘p’),
MC pðtÞ¼½1/C0ð1/C0sÞt/C138ð A:6:4Þ
(A 218) Equations (A.6.3) and (A.6.4) show that MC b=M C p= s for the ﬁrst post-
radiation generation following either a one-time or a permanent increase in mutationrate. With no further irradiation in subsequent generations, the value of MC will de-cay back to zero at a rate of (1 /C0s) per generation. With a permanent increase in
mutation rate, however, the MC value will slowly increase to 1 at the new equilib-
rium. Consistent with these changes in MC, for a one-time irradiation scenario,
the disease frequency will show a transitory increase in the ﬁrst generation, but overtime, reach the earlier or ‘old’ equilibrium value; for a permanent increase in muta-tion rate, the disease frequency will continue to increase until the new equilibriumICRP Publication 103
223value of MC = 1 is reached. At the new equilibrium, an x% increase in mutation rate
will result in an x% increase in disease frequency.
(A 219) Mutation component for X-linked and autosomal recessive diseases. For
X-linked diseases, for a one-time increase in mutation rate, the ﬁrst generationMC = s, as in the case of autosomal dominants, but the s value needs to be adjusted
to take into account the fact that only one-third of the total X-chromosome comple-
ment is in males. The dynamics of change in MC in subsequent generations is similarto that for autosomal dominants. For autosomal recessives, MC in the ﬁrst genera-tion is close to zero (consistent with the fact that an autosomal recessive mutationdoes not result in disease in the ﬁrst generation).
(A 220) With a permanent increase in mutation rate, for both kinds of diseases,
MC progressively increases to reach a value of 1 at the new equilibrium, but the ratesof approach to the new equilibrium are diﬀerent and are dictated by s values and
time (in generations) following irradiation. In particular, for autosomal recessive dis-
eases, the rate of approach to the new equilibrium is very slow and much slower thanthat for autosomal dominants and X-linked diseases.
(A 221) The important point that emerges from the above discussion is that MC is
related to s and therefore, given s, one can estimate the dynamics of increase in MCand in disease frequencies for any post-radiation generation of interest. As men-tioned in paragraph (A 211), the average selection coeﬃcient estimated from dataon naturally occurring autosomal dominant diseases is 0.294. This value, rounded
to 0.30, is the one used as the best estimate for MC for autosomal dominant and
X-linked diseases.
(A 222) Mutation component for chronic diseases. As mentioned earlier, multifac-
torial diseases have a high population frequency, but, unlike in the case of Mendeliandiseases, the lack of adequate models to explain their stable frequencies in the pop-ulation precluded any meaningful assessment of the radiation risk of these diseases.Descriptive models such as the multifactorial threshold model (MTM) of disease lia-bility to explain the observed transmission patterns of these diseases and to estimate
risks to relatives of aﬀected individuals from data on population frequencies have ex-
isted for a long time but, as such, they are not suitable for assessing the impact of anincrease in mutation rate on disease frequency. Similarly, although there was awealth of literature on mechanistic models (that invoke mutation and selection asopposing forces in the evolution and maintenance of variability of polygenic/quan-titative traits in populations), none of these models was geared towards assessingthe impact of an increase in mutation rate on the frequency of multifactorialdiseases.
(A 223) The ICRP Task Group drafting Publication 83 (ICRP 1999b) took the ﬁrst
step in addressing the above issue by formulating a ‘hybrid model’ which includedsome elements of the MTM and some of the mechanistic models mentioned above.The hybrid model is henceforth referred to as the ‘ﬁnite locus threshold model’(FLTM). Although the original intention was to use the model to estimate MCfor both congenital abnormalities and chronic diseases, it soon became clear thatits use for congenital abnormalities is not biologically meaningful and consequently,the 1999 Task Group decided to limit its use to chronic diseases only. As discussedICRP Publication 103
224later in this Annex, this does not pose any problem for estimating the risk of congen-
ital abnormalities since this can now be done without recourse to the DD method.To provide a background, the assumptions and use of the MTM are ﬁrst discussedbelow.
(A 224) Multifactorial threshold model (MTM) of disease liability. In the absence
of information on the genetic or environmental factors that underlie multifactorial
diseases, in the early 1960s the MTM used in quantitative genetics for thresholdcharacters was extended to these diseases to explain their transmission patternsand estimate risks to relatives. Since multifactorial diseases are ‘all-or-none’ traits(unlike quantitative traits such as height or weight), in order to use the MTM forthese diseases, it was necessary to postulate a hypothetical variable called ‘liability’that underlies multifactorial diseases and a ‘threshold’ of liability which, when ex-ceeded, would result in disease (Carter, 1961, Falconer, 1965). Worthy of note here
is the fact that the MTM has been (and remains) useful for our understanding of
familial aggregations and recurrence risks in families, and makes good predictionseven when there is uncertainty about the underlying mechanisms. Details of theMTM for disease liability have been discussed in a number of publications (seeICRP, 1999b for a listing of the references).
(A 225) Brieﬂy, the assumptions of the standard version of MTM are the
following:
/C15all environmental and genetic causes can be combined into a single continuousvariable called ‘liability’ which cannot, as such, be measured;
/C15liability is determined by a combination of numerous (essentially an inﬁnite num-ber of) genetic and environmental factors, that act additively, without dominanceor epistasis, each contributing a small amount of liability and therefore show aGaussian (normal) distribution; and
/C15the aﬀected individuals are those whose liability exceeds a certain threshold value.
(A 226) The MTM enables the conversion of information on the incidence of a
given multifactorial disease in the population (P) and in the relatives of those aﬀected
(q) into an estimate of correlation in liability between relatives from which a quantity
called heritability ( h2), which provides a measure of the relative importance of genet-
ic factors in disease causation, can be estimated.
(A 227) Heritability. Heritability, a common statistic used in quantitative genetics,
provides a measure of the relative importance of transmissible genetic variation tothe overall phenotypic variation. Since the phenotype owes its origin to geneticand environmental factors, in the analysis of variance, the total phenotypic variance(V
P) is usually partitioned into two components, genetic (V G) and environmental
(VE), assuming that these are independent of each other (i.e., they are not corre-
lated). The ratio V G/VPis called the ‘broad-sense heritability’, or degree of genetic
determination, symbolised by h2(strictly, h2
B). Estimates of the heritability of liabil-
ity for many multifactorial diseases have been published in the literature and are inthe range from about 0.30 to 0.80 although for most types of cancer the heritabilitycoeﬃcient is judged to be less than 0.30.ICRP Publication 103
225(A 228) The genotypic variance, V G, can be subdivided into an additive compo-
nent (V A) and a component due to deviations from additivity. Additive genetic var-
iance is the component that is attributable to the average eﬀects of genes consideredsingly, as transmitted in the gametes. The ratio, V
A/VG, called ‘narrow-sense herita-
bility’ h2
N, determines the magnitude of correlation between relatives (Falconer,
1960).
(A 229) The ﬁnite-locus-threshold model used for estimating MC for chronic dis-
eases. The FLTM incorporates the assumptions of liability threshold from the
MTM (but suitably redeﬁned to take into account mutations at a ﬁnite number ofgenes) and the concepts of mutation and selection from models on the maintenanceand evolution of polygenic variability underlying quantitative traits. The choice ofthe FLTM was dictated by two main considerations: a) current knowledge of the ge-netic basis of well-studied chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD),
supports the view that a large proportion of the variability of intermediate quantita-
tive traits (such as serum cholesterol levels, a risk factor for CHD) in the populationis due to mutations at a limited number of gene loci (ICRP, 1999b, Sankaranaraya-nan et al., 1999) and b) in the absence of precise information on the genetic basis ofmost multifactorial diseases, the FLTM provides a useful starting point because,with such a model, the meaning of parameters reﬂecting mutation rates and selectioncan be quantitatively assessed in terms of those for single gene eﬀects.
(A 230) Brieﬂy, the FLTM assumes that the liability to disease, made up of genetic
and environmental factors, is a continuous variable. The genetic component of lia-
bility is discrete, i.e., it is determined by the total number of mutant genes (deﬁnedas a random variable, g, the number of mutant genes in a genotype at nloci) and the
environmental eﬀect, e, which is a random variable which has a Gaussian (normal)
distribution with mean = 0 and variance = V
e. The total liability therefore has two
components: a) a function [ f(g)] of the number of mutant genes in the n-locus geno-
type of an individual and b) a normally distributed environmental eﬀect, e. The
threshold characteristic of the model is described by assuming that individuals with
liability exceeding a threshold value Tare phenotypically aﬀected and have a ﬁtness
of (1 /C0s) and those below it are normal with ﬁtness equal to 1.
(A 231) Although the mathematical formulations of the FLTM cannot be ex-
pressed in the form of a single equation, the predictions of the model can be itera-tively evaluated from the computer program that was developed for this purpose.The steps include the following: ﬁrst, with a deﬁned set of parameter values (muta-tion rate, selection coeﬃcients, threshold, etc.), the program is run until the popula-tion reaches equilibrium between mutation and selection. When this is achieved, the
mutation rate is increased once or permanently and the computer run is resumed
with the new mutation rate (with the other parameters remaining the same). Thechanges in the magnitude of MC and its relationship to heritability of liability ( h
2)
are examined in desired generations and at the new equilibrium. The h2estimates
are not inputs, but outputs of the program, obtained with diﬀerent combinationsof parameter values (for the numbers of gene loci from 3 to 6, mutation rate, selec-tion coeﬃcients, environmental variance, and threshold). The conclusions discussedICRP Publication 103
226below are for the 5-locus model, but they remain qualitatively unaltered for other
values of the number of gene loci.
(A 232) Main conclusions of the computer simulation studies. In these studies, a
5-locus model was used and the relationship between h2and changes in MC were
assessed for two scenarios: a) the population sustains an increase in mutation rate
every generation, and b) the population sustains an increase in mutation rate in
one generation only. The initial (spontaneous) mutation rate assumed in the calcu-lations was 10
/C06per gene and the eﬀects were examined for a 15% increase in muta-
tion rate (i.e., 1.0 10/C06/gene to 1.15 10/C06/gene) with selection coeﬃcients, s= 0.2 to
0.8. The conclusions are the following:
/C15Under conditions of a permanent increase in mutation rate, the MC at the newequilibrium is close to 1 over a wide range of h
2values from about 0.3 to 0.8 that
are of importance in the present context; stated diﬀerently, an x% increase inmutation rate will cause an x% increase in disease frequency at the new
equilibrium.
/C15Again, under the same conditions and over the same range of h2values, the MC in
the ﬁrst several generations is very small, in the range 0.01–0.02, often closer to0.01 than to 0.02. In other words, the predicted relative increase in disease fre-quency is very small.
/C15If the population sustains radiation exposure in one generation only, the MC inthe ﬁrst generation is as indicated in the previous conclusion, and its value grad-ually decays back to zero.
/C15The above three conclusions are valid when there is no sporadic component ofdisease, i.e., non-occurrence of individuals with disease that is unrelated to thegenotype; when sporadics occur, the eﬀect is to reduce the MC both in early gen-erations and at the new equilibrium.
(A 233) The conclusions discussed above hold for so many diﬀerent combinations
of parameter values (i.e., threshold, selection coeﬃcient, number of loci, environ-mental variance, spontaneous mutation rate, increases in mutation rate, etc.) thatthey can be considered robust. Additionally, it was found that, for mutation ratesof the order known for Mendelian genes, the FLTM with a few loci and weak selec-tion provides a good approximation to study the possible increases in the frequenciesof chronic diseases in populations exposed to radiation.
(A 234) In its 2001 report UNSCEAR used MC = 0.02 as the best estimate in the
risk equation for estimating the risk of chronic diseases.
The concept of potential recoverability correction factor
(A 235) The use of Eqn. (A.6.1) (i.e., risk = P ·[1/DD] ·MC) for risk estimation
implies that the genes at which spontaneous mutations are known to cause disease(included under P) will also respond to induced mutations, that such mutations willbe compatible with viability and therefore recoverable in live born progeny of irra-
diated individuals. This assumption gained support from studies of induced muta-
tions in speciﬁc genes in several model systems. However, no radiation-inducedICRP Publication 103
227germ-cell gene mutations, let alone induced genetic diseases, have thus far been iden-
tiﬁed in human studies.
(A 236) Advances in human molecular biology and in radiobiology have now
shown that: a) spontaneous disease-causing mutations and radiation-induced muta-tions in experimental systems diﬀer in several respects, both in their nature and in the
mechanisms by which they arise (or are induced); b) there are both structural and
functional constraints that preclude the recoverability of induced mutations in allgenomic regions, i.e., only a small proportion of human genes of relevance fromthe disease point of view are likely to be responsive to radiation-induced mutationsthat are recoverable in live born progeny; and c) genes that have hitherto been usedin studies on induced mutations are those that are non-essential for viability and alsohappen to be located in genomic regions, also non-essential for viability (reviewed inSankaranarayanan 1999). So the crux of the argument is that the induced mutation
rates from mouse studies that are used in risk estimation are likely to be overesti-
mates of the rate at which induced mutations in humans will precipitate disease.
(A 237) Since there is no alternative to the use of mouse data on induced muta-
tions for risk estimation, methods need to be devised to bridge the gap betweenempirically determined rates of induced mutations in mice and the rates at which dis-ease-causing mutations may be recovered in human live births. One such methodthat has been developed involves the incorporation of a correction factor termed ‘po-tential recoverability correction factor’ (PRCF) into risk Eqn. (A.6.1) so that the risk
now becomes a product of four quantities instead of the original three:
Risk per unit dose ¼P/C2½1=DD/C138/C2MC/C2PRCF ðA:6:5Þ
where the ﬁrst three are as deﬁned earlier and PRCF is the disease-class speciﬁc po-
tential recoverability correction factor. Since PRCF is a fraction, the estimate of riskwill now be lower.
(A 238) In order to estimate potential recoverability of induced mutations, a set of
criteria was ﬁrst deﬁned using molecular information on recovered mutations in
experimental systems. The operative words are the italicised ones, since a) knowledgeof the structural and functional genomics of the human genome is not yet complete;b) so far, no radiation-induced human germ cell mutations have been recovered toprovide a frame of reference; and c) the criteria may change with advances in knowl-edge in the coming years. The criteria that could be developed were then applied tohuman genes of relevance from the disease point of view, taking into account genesize, organisation, function, genomic context (i.e., whether the gene is located in a
‘gene-rich’ or ‘gene-poor’ region), spectra of spontaneous mutations in the gene,
whether deletions, including contiguous genes, are known in the region, and theknown mutational mechanisms. The question asked was: if a deletion (the predom-inant type of radiation-induced change) were to be induced in this gene/gene region,would it be potentially recoverable in a live birth?
(A 239) Details of the criteria used and the classiﬁcation of the genes into three
groups, viz. group 1, ‘induced deletion is unlikely to be recovered’, group 2, ‘uncer-tain recoverability’, and group 3, ‘potentially recoverable’, are discussed in detail by
Sankaranarayanan and Chakraborty (2000b) and in the UNSCEAR (2001) report.ICRP Publication 103
228Since the assignment to group 1 is less subjective (and therefore relatively more reli-
able), to err on the side of caution, potential recoverability was calculated as follows:if a total of Ngenes are analysed and if namong them could be excluded as ‘unlikely
to be recovered’, the remainder (made up of groups 2 and 3) constitute ( N/C0n) and
the fraction ( N/C0n)/Nprovides a crude measure of genes at which induced muta-
tions may be recoverable. This fraction is called the ‘unweighted’ PRCF.
(A 240) The PRCF as estimated above, however, does not take into account dif-
ferences in incidence of the diﬀerent diseases. For example, if a disease with high inci-dence belongs to group 1, societal concern will be far less than when it belongs to theother groups. Consequently, a weighted PRCF was also calculated. If Pis the total
incidence of diseases due to mutations in Ngenes, and pis the incidence of diseases
due to mutations in ( N/C0n) genes, then [ p(N/C0n)/PN] represents the ‘weighted
PRCF’.
(A 241) The results of analysis of a total of 67 autosomal and X-linked genes are
summarised in Table A.6.2.
(A 242) PRCF for autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases. In view of the fact
that autosomal dominants have an order-of-magnitude higher overall incidence thanX-linked ones (1.5% versus 0.15%), the PRCFs for the former are more relevant.UNSCEAR therefore suggested the use of the PRCF range of 0.15 to 0.30 in the riskequation for estimating the risk of both autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases.
(A 243) PRCF for autosomal recessives. While the recoverability of induced reces-
sive mutations is also subject to structural and functional constraints, in view of the
fact that these mutations are ﬁrst present in heterozygotes (and 50% of the geneproducts are generally suﬃcient for normal function), one can assume that even largedeletions may be recoverable in the heterozygotes. Additionally, as discussed earlier,induced recessive mutations do not, at least in the ﬁrst several generations, result inrecessive diseases. Consequently, no attempt was made to estimate PRCF forTable A.6.2. Summary of assessments of potential recoverability of radiation-induced
mutations in autosomal and X-linked genes.

229recessive diseases. However, it should be noted that ignoring PRCF in the risk equa-
tion is equivalent to assuming PRCF = 1, but in reality this does not aﬀect the esti-mate of risk – since MC is nearly zero in the ﬁrst several generations, the product ofP and MC is already zero.
(A 244) PRCF for chronic diseases. As may be recalled, in the FLTM used to esti-
mate MC for chronic diseases, one of the assumptions is that of simultaneous in-
crease in mutation rate in all the underlying genes which, in turn, causes theliability to exceed the threshold. A crude approximation of the PRCF for each mul-tifactorial phenotype is the x
thpower of that for mutations at a single locus, where x
is the number of gene loci, assumed to be independent of each other, that underliethe disease. Since the PRCF for single gene mutations is in the range from 0.15 to0.30, for chronic diseases, the ﬁgures become 0.15
xto 0.30x. With the assumption
of just two loci, the estimates become 0.02 to 0.09 and, with more loci, substantially
smaller. Intuitively, these conclusions are not unexpected when one considers that
here one is estimating the probability of simultaneous recoverability of inducedmutations at more than one independent gene.
(A 245) UNSCEAR adopted the PRCF range of 0.02 to 0.09 with the view that
the use of this range will not underestimate risk.
(A 246) PRCF for congenital abnormalities. The available data do not permit
PRCF estimation for congenital abnormalities. However, since risk estimation forthis class of diseases is now done without using the DD method (see the next sec-
tion), our inability to estimate PRCF is not a problem.
The concept that multisystem developmental abnormalities are likely to be the major
manifestations of radiation-induced genetic damage in humans
(A 247) As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, in genetic risk estimation, the
emphasis has been on expressing risks in terms of inducible genetic diseases, theexpectation being that their phenotypes will be similar to those known from studiesof naturally occurring genetic diseases. However, when one considers the following
facts it is clear that the emphasis on genetic diseases gives only a partial answer to the
question of genetic risks. The facts and observations are:
/C15radiation induces genetic damage through random deposition of energy;
/C15the whole genome is the target;
/C15most radiation-induced mutations studied in experimental systems are DNA dele-tions, often encompassing more than one gene;
/C15the recoverability of induced deletions is subject to structural and functional con-straints so that only a small proportion of them are compatible with live births; and
/C15the phenotype of viability-compatible deletions will reﬂect the gene functions that
are lost because of the deletion and we do not as yet have ‘windows’ for all geno-
mic regions.
It follows therefore, that the problem in genetic risk estimation is one of delineat-
ing the phenotypes of viability-compatible deletions that may be induced in diﬀerent
genomic regions which may or may not have counterparts in naturally occurringgenetic diseases.ICRP Publication 103
230(A 248) Microdeletion syndromes in humans. Some inferences are now possible on
the potential phenotypes of radiation-induced deletions from studies of naturallyoccurring microdeletion syndromes in humans. These result from deletions of multi-ple, physically contiguous, often functionally unrelated, genes that are compatiblewith viability in heterozygous condition and are identiﬁed clinically through a char-
acteristic association of unusual appearance and defective organ development. Many
examples of microdeletions have been (and continue to be) reported in the humangenetics literature. They have been found in nearly all the chromosomes, but theiroccurrence in diﬀerent chromosomal regions is non-random (e.g., Brewer et al.,1998). This is not unexpected in the light of diﬀerences in gene density in diﬀerentchromosomes/chromosomal regions. The important point here is that, despite theiroccurrence in diﬀerent chromosomes, the common denominators of the phenotypeof many of these deletions are: mental retardation, a speciﬁc pattern of dysmorphic
features, serious malformations, and growth retardation. These ﬁndings in humans
are supported, among others, by studies of Cattanach et al. (1993, 1996) showingthat, in the mouse, radiation-induced multilocus deletions constitute the genetic basisfor a signiﬁcant proportion of growth-retarded animals recovered in their work.
(A 249) It was therefore suggested that the predominant adverse eﬀects of gonadal
irradiation in humans are likely to be manifest as multisystem developmental abnor-malities which are formally called ‘congenital abnormalities’ (Sankaranarayanan,1999). However, unlike naturally occurring congenital abnormalities which are inter-
preted as being multifactorial, radiation-induced congenital abnormalities, because

231they are multilocus deletions, are predicted to show, by and large, autosomal dom-
inant patterns of inheritance. This prediction has been fulﬁlled in mouse radiationstudies on skeletal abnormalities (Ehling, 1965, 1966, Selby and Selby, 1977), cata-racts (Favor, 1989), growth retardation (Searle and Beechey, 1986), and congenitalanomalies (Kirk and Lyon, 1984, Lyon and Renshaw, 1988, Nomura, 1982, 1988,
1994). No transmission tests could be carried out, however, for congenital abnormal-
ities because they were ascertained in utero.
(A 250) Risk of developmental abnormalities. UNSCEAR (2001) used the mouse
data on skeletal abnormalities, cataracts and congenital abnormalities (appropriatelyadjusting the rates for chronic low-LET radiation conditions) to obtain an overallestimate of the risk of developmental abnormalities about 20 10
/C04Gy/C01(given in
Table A.6.3 in this document under the heading ‘congenital abnormalities’ as 2000per Gy per million for the ﬁrst generation). All the data used in these calculations
come from studies of irradiation of males, and the rate so estimated was assumed
to be applicable to both sexes.
A.6.4. The 2001 UNSCEAR risk estimates
Estimates of genetic risk for a population sustaining radiation exposure generation
after generation
(A 251) Table A.6.3 summarises the risk estimates presented in the 2001 UNSCE-
AR report. The risks given below and in the tables are expressed as the predicted
number of additional cases (i.e., over the baseline) of diﬀerent classes of genetic dis-ease per million live births per Gy for a population exposed to low-LET, low-dose orchronic irradiation, generation after generation. For all classes except congenitalabnormalities, the estimates are based on a DD of 1 Gy and the respective valuesof P, MC and PRCF for the diﬀerent classes. For congenital abnormalities, the riskestimate comes from mouse data (discussed in the preceding paragraph) and is notbased on the DD method.
(A 252) As can be noted from Table A.6.3, the ﬁrst generation risk (i.e., the risk to
the children of an exposed population) is estimated to be of the order of 750 to 1500cases per million live births per Gy for autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases,zero for autosomal recessive diseases, 250 to 1200 cases for chronic diseases and 2000cases of congenital abnormalities. The total risk is of the order of about 3000 to 4700cases which represent about 0.4 to 0.6% of the baseline risk.
(A 253) The risk to the second generation (i.e., to the grandchildren) becomes
slightly higher for all classes except for chronic diseases in view of the fact that
the mutation component for these diseases does not increase over the ﬁrst several
generations.
Estimates of genetic risks for a population that sustains radiation exposure in one
generation only
(A 254) The estimates of genetic risk under conditions when the population sus-
tains radiation exposure in one generation only (and no further radiation in subse-quent generations) are presented in Table A.6.4. Again, all estimates are expressedICRP Publication 103
232per Gy per million progeny. As expected, the ﬁrst generation risks (i.e., risks to the
children of those exposed) are the same as those given in Table A.6.3. With no fur-ther radiation, the risk of autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases to the secondgeneration (i.e., to the grandchildren) declines as a result of selection. For chronicmultifactorial diseases, since the mutation component remains low for several gener-ations, the risk to the second generation remains about the same as that in the ﬁrstgeneration. The risk of congenital abnormalities is predicted to be of the order of 400to 1000 cases (under the assumption that about 20 to 50% of those aﬀected in the ﬁrst
generation transmit the damage to the next generation).
Strengths and limitations of the risk estimates
(A 255) On the basis of UNSCEAR (2001) the Commission has, for the ﬁrst time,
been able to provide ICRP estimates of risks for all classes of genetic diseases. Whilethese estimates reﬂect the current state of knowledge in this area, the strengths andlimitations of these estimates need to be borne in mind, in view of various assump-tions that have been used.
(A 256) Equal mutational sensitivity of human males and females. The prevalent
view that the mouse immature oocytes may not be an adequate model for assessingthe mutational radiosensitivity of human immature oocytes necessitated the assump-tion that human females and males have the same mutational radiosensitivity whichin turn is equal to that of mouse males. If, however, human females have a lowerTable A.6.4. Current estimates of genetic risks from one-generation exposure to low-LET,

233sensitivity in this regard, the average rate of induced mutations would be expected to
be lower than the one used. In turn, this implies that the DD will be higher (and 1/DD will be smaller than 0.01 that has been used). At present it is not possible to ad-dress this issue.
(A 257) Average spontaneous and induced mutation rates used in DD calculations.
As may be recalled, the average estimate of 2.95 10
/C06per human gene was based
on an estimated 135 genes underlying some 26 autosomal dominant disease pheno-types which constitute a subset of such diseases included in the estimate of baselinefrequencies. Bearing in mind the fact that the human genome contains about 30,000genes, one can only speculate whether the above average spontaneous mutation rateestimate is an over- or underestimate of the true average rate.
(A 258) Similarly, although the estimate of induced mutation rate for mouse genes
is based on more data than was the case until now, the total number of genes in-
cluded in the present analysis is still only 34 and, in a sizeable proportion of them,
induced mutations were rare. Therefore, while the possibility remains that the pres-ently estimated induced rate may be biased upwards, its extent is diﬃcult to deter-mine at present.
(A 259) Mutation components. The estimate MC = 0.3 for autosomal dominant
and X-linked diseases is based on the average svalue for the autosomal dominant
diseases (since MC = sin the ﬁrst generation), the data of which provided the basis
for spontaneous mutation rate calculations. However, it should be realised that, for a
substantial proportion of diseases, onset is in middle and later ages (i.e., beyond the
age of reproduction) which means that sis smaller and therefore the MC value used
may be an overestimate.
(A 260) Potential recoverability correction factors. For autosomal dominant and
X-linked diseases, a range of PRCF from 0.15 to 0.30 was used, the lower limit beinga weighted estimate and the upper limit, an unweighted one. However, the criteriadeveloped for potential recoverability of induced deletions do not include breakpointspeciﬁcities which are undoubtedly important in the case of deletion-associated nat-
urally occurring Mendelian diseases. It seems unlikely that radiation-induced dele-
tions would share these speciﬁcities, and certainly not in all genomic regions. Ifthese speciﬁcities are indeed relevant for recovering induced deletions, even theweighted PRCF may be an overestimate.
(A 261) For chronic diseases, it has been assumed that the PRCF may simply be
thex
thpower of that for a single-gene disease, with x= the number of genes which
have to be simultaneously mutated to cause disease; the values of 0.02 to 0.09 haveassumed x= 2 (the minimum number). Although, statistically, such a calculation can
be defended, the implicit biological assumption that, at low doses of radiation, two
independent mutations underlying a chronic disease may be simultaneously inducedand recovered seems unrealistic.
(A 262) There is an additional issue here, namely that the PRCF for chronic dis-
eases is very sensitive to x(e.g., even if x= 3, the PRCF range becomes 0.003 to
0.03). The essence of the argument then is that the PRCFs used for chronic diseasesmay overestimate the risk.ICRP Publication 103
234(A 263) Overlap in estimates of risk. It should be recalled that: a) the estimates for
autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases have been obtained using the DD meth-od; b) the risk of induced congenital abnormalities which are also adverse dominanteﬀects have been estimated independently using mouse data without recourse to theDD method; and c) the risk of ‘chromosomal diseases’ has been assumed to be sub-
sumed under the risk of autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases. The important
point here is that, since all these represent dominant eﬀects (and mutations in manydevelopmental genes are known to cause Mendelian diseases), there must be overlapbetween the classes of risk grouped under the headings of ‘autosomal dominant +X-linked’ and ‘congenital abnormalities’ although it is diﬃcult to assess its magni-tude. The consequence is that the sum may overestimate the actual risk of dominanteﬀects.
A.6.5. Earlier and present assessments of risk estimates by ICRP for deriving risk
coeﬃcients for genetic eﬀects
ICRP Publication 60
(A 264) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), the commission used the genetic risk esti-
mates then available (UNSCEAR, 1988, NRC, 1990) as a starting point for derivingrisk coeﬃcients for ‘severe heritable eﬀects’. It is important to mention here that inthe commission’s calculations then, while the DD assumed (1 Gy) was the same as
that used now, the baseline frequency of Mendelian diseases was only about one-half
of that currently used (1.25% then versus 2.4% now). Additionally, for multifactorialdiseases as a whole (estimated baseline frequency of 71%; same as now), the Com-mission assumed that MC = 0.05 for all post-radiation generations (this assumptionis incorrect in the light of current calculations; see paragraphs (A 216) to (A 234))and also incorporated an additional arbitrary correction factor (called ‘severity cor-rection factor’) of 1/3 to estimate the proportion of inducible multifactorial diseasesthat may be deemed ‘severe’ (no such correction is used in the present assessments).
(A 265) For a population exposed to low-dose-rate, low-LET irradiation, the risk
coeﬃcients estimated by ICRP (1991b) are summarised in Table A.6.5 (see alsoTable 3 of Sankaranarayanan 1991).
(A 266) The estimates for the ‘reproductive population’ apply when the radiation
doses received by all individuals in the population are genetically signiﬁcant. How-ever, when the total population of all ages is considered, the genetically signiﬁcantdose will be markedly lower than the total dose received over a lifetime. Geneticdamage sustained by germ cells of individuals who are beyond the reproductive per-
iod, or who are not procreating for any reason, poses no genetic risks. On the
assumption that the average life expectancy at birth is of the order of 75 years,the dose received by 30 years of age (i.e., the mean reproductive age) is 40% (i.e.,30/75 = 0.4) of the total dose. The risk coeﬃcients for the total population, therefore,are estimated to be 40% of the above values.
(A 267) Although ICRP (1991b) presented risk coeﬃcients for the ﬁrst two gener-
ations as well as for the new equilibrium, it used the equilibrium estimate of 1.0 10
/C02
Gy/C01for the total population (with an additional weighting factor for years of lifeICRP Publication 103
235lost to arrive at a ﬁgure of 1.3 10/C02Gy/C01for ‘severe heritable eﬀects’ in its summary
table of ‘nominal probability coeﬃcients’ (Table 3, ICRP 1991b).
Current assessments
(A 268) In its current assessments, the Commission used the estimates of risk pre-
sented in Table A.6.3 as starting points. The upper and lower limits of each of theestimated ranges were ﬁrst used to obtain average estimates, and the latter were thencombined to generate a single estimate of risk coeﬃcient for all genetic eﬀects. De-
tails of calculations are given in the next section.
(A 269) Risk coeﬃcients up to two generations for a population sustaining radiation
exposure in every generation.
/C15risk of Mendelian diseases = 1300 to 2500 cases per 106progeny per Gy (= 0.13
10/C02to 0.25 10/C02Gy/C01; average: 0.19 10/C02Gy/C01);
/C15risk of chronic multifactorial diseases = 250 to 1200 cases per 106progeny per Gy
(= 0.03 10/C02Gy/C01to 0.12 10/C02Gy/C01; average: 0.08 10/C02Gy/C01);
/C15risk of congenital abnormalities = 2400 to 3000 cases per 106progeny per Gy (0.24
10/C02to 0.30 10/C02Gy/C01; average: 0.27 10/C02Gy/C01); and,
/C15risk of all classes (i.e., the above three risks combined) = 3950 to 6700 cases per
106progeny per Gy or 0.40 10/C02to 0.67 10/C02Gy/C01; average: 0.54 10/C02Gy/C01.
The above estimates are for a reproductive population. For the total population,
the estimates are multiplied by 0.4. All the estimates are summarised in Table A.6.6.
(A 270) It is evident that, despite diﬀerent baseline frequencies for Mendelian dis-
eases, MCs and diﬀerences in risk estimates for comparable classes of diseases, thepresent estimates for the reproductive (0.54) as well as for the total population(0.22) are remarkably similar to those arrived at in ICRP Publication 60 (1991b);
respectively, 0.53 and 0.19; see Table 5. It should be stressed that this similarity isa matter of pure coincidence!Table A.6.5. Estimates of risk coeﬃcients in Publication 60 for a population sustaining

aThe estimate used by ICRP (1991b) in its summary of ‘nominal probability coeﬃcients for
stochastic eﬀects’ (Table 3, ICRP, 1991b); the ﬁgure given in that Table of 1.3 10/C02Gy/C01takes
into account a weighting factor for years of life lost (ICRP, 1991b).ICRP Publication 103
236(A 271) As may be recalled, the ranges in the estimates of risk coeﬃcients for Men-
delian and chronic diseases are a reﬂection of the ranges of PRCFs (0.15 to 0.30 forautosomal dominant and X-linked diseases and 0.02 to 0.09 for chronic diseases).Arguments to suggest that the upper limits of these ranges may represent overesti-mates and that the actual values may be closer to the lower limits were presentedin Section A.6.3. If this reasoning is accepted, then it is meaningful to use the lowerlimit of the ranges for the above two classes of diseases and the average of the rangefor congenital abnormalities. When this is done, the risk coeﬃcients become smaller
than those presented in Table A.6.6 as noted below:
/C15Reproductive population: Mendelian diseases, 0.13; chronic diseases, 0.03; congen-
ital abnormalities, 0.27; Total: 0.43 10/C02Gy/C01

eases are used, then the estimates are 0.30 10

Justiﬁcation for using risk estimates up to generation two versus for calculating risk
coeﬃcients
(A 274) There are some problems in comparing genetic risk coeﬃcients with those
for cancers. This is because of the fact that cancer risk coeﬃcients quantify the prob-ability of harmful eﬀects of radiation to the exposed individuals themselves, andgenetic risk coeﬃcients quantify the probability of harmful eﬀects to the descendantsof those exposed resulting from the induction of germline mutations and their trans-mission over generations. Following consideration of the available data and therecent analyses of UNSCEAR (2001) and NAS/NRC (2006), the Commission posi-tion is to express genetic risks up to the second generation (Table A.6.6). As given
below, there are important scientiﬁc arguments that favour this approach.
(A 275) The population genetic theory of equilibrium between mutation and selec-
tion that underlies the use of the doubling dose method and the available mathemat-ical formulations permit, in principle, the prediction of genetic risks at the newequilibrium (under conditions of continuous radiation in every generation). As notedearlier, in the absence of informative analyses and in order not to underestimategenetic risks, Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) used the equilibrium estimates as a basis
for calculating risk coeﬃcients for genetic eﬀects. The current arguments against
such an equilibrium calculation centre on the very unrealistic and untestable assump-
tions that a) the estimates of selection coeﬃcients, mutation components, and theother quantities used in the risk equation, will remain valid for tens or hundredsof human generations; b) the population structure, demography and health carefacilities will remain constant over many hundreds of years.
(A 276) In the view of the Commission these assumptions can no longer be sus-
tained and therefore, for the practical purposes of radiological protection, the Com-mission recommends a genetic risk estimate based upon risks up to the second
generation. UNSCEAR (2001) and NAS/NRC (2006) have made the same judge-
ment on this matter.
(A 277) The concepts that a) radiation-induced genetic changes are predominantly
deletions, often encompassing more than one gene, and that only a small proportionof such induced deletions is compatible with live births, and b) radiation-inducedheritable eﬀects in humans are more likely to be manifest as multisystem develop-mental abnormalities in the progeny rather than as diseases due to mutations in sin-gle genes, are particularly relevant to this issue. Because reproductive ﬁtness of the
aﬀected progeny will be reduced, many radiation-induced genetic changes aﬀecting
development are expected to be strongly selected against at the ﬁrst and second gen-erations. It is judged therefore that expressing genetic risks up to the second gener-ation will not lead to any substantial underestimate of the heritable eﬀects ofradiation.
(A 278) Nevertheless a degree of caution is used in the derivation of a tissue
weighting factor for the gonads. In respect of whole populations, Table A.4.1a givesrelative detriment values of 0.044 for heritable eﬀects and 0.017 for ovarian cancer.ICRP Publication 103
238The sum of these computed values, 0.061, is less than the judged tissue weighting fac-
tor of 0.08 (Table A.4.3).
(A 279) In addition, the Commission notes that because of the diﬀerent ways used
to calculate the risk of autosomal dominant plus X-linked disease (the DD method)and congenital abnormalities (directly from mouse data), there must be a consider-
able element of ‘double counting’ of risk. Therefore, the summing of these risk cat-
egories, as used conventionally by UNSCEAR and ICRP, must represent asigniﬁcant overestimate of genetic risk overall.
(A 280) Finally the Commission has considered whether an estimate of genetic risks
at say 5 or 10 generations might be more appropriate. This judgement can be informedby some of the model predictions provided by UNSCEAR (UNSCEAR 2001).
(A 281) With the parameters speciﬁed, the model used by UNSCEAR and by the
Commission predicts that, for a permanent increase in mutation rate, the responsive-
ness of disease incidence (mutation component, MC) is most pronounced for auto-
somal dominant diseases, less so for X-linked diseases, and far less pronounced forautosomal recessives. In this respect, for autosomal dominants, disease frequency inthe population at generations 5 and 10 is predicted to be less than a factor 1.5 greaterthan that at generation 2 (Fig. V, UNSCEAR, 2001).
(A 282) The position regarding the responsiveness of multifactorial diseases is
illustrated in Fig. VII of UNSCEAR 2001 which gives the relationship betweenmutation component and heritability of liability. These relationships are not signif-
icantly diﬀerent at generations 1, 5 and 10. Further to this, for the dose rate of inter-
est the model predicts minimal responsiveness (MC
TU) of these disorders at
generation 10 to a permanent increase in mutation rate.
(A 283) It is notable that the above modelling predictions are wholly consistent
with several animal genetic studies (largely with mice) that provide no evidence ofthe accumulation of a mutational load following x-irradiation at each generationup to more than 30 generations (reviewed by Green 1968 and UNSCEAR 1972).
(A 284) Overall, the Commission concludes that expressing the heritable risks of
radiation at generations 5 or 10 rather than 2 would not materially aﬀect judgements
on the risk coeﬃcient.
(A 285) In conclusion, the Commission, whilst fully recognising uncertainties,
agrees with the UNSCEAR 2001 judgement (paragraph 531) that ‘the risk estimatespresented for the ﬁrst two generations adequately reﬂect the current state of knowl-edge in this evolving area’. ICRP will maintain surveillance on scientiﬁc develop-ments in the area and, if judged to be appropriate, will revise its estimates of theseheritable risks.

posals from the Task Group that drafted this Annex are based upon ICRP Commit-tee 1 judgements developed over the past 10 years or so. Accordingly many sections
of the Annex are themselves summaries of these pre-existing judgements. For this
reason a simple tabular format (Table A.7.1) has been used to provide an overallsummary of the principal conclusions that have now been adopted by the Commis-sion. The inclusion in Table A.7.1 of identiﬁers for the relevant sections and tablesfor each topic serves to map the document and guide readers to the topic of interest.These sections often detail methodologies, uncertainties and caveats not fully re-ﬂected in Table A.7.1. Accordingly Table A.7.1 cannot be taken as being fully infor-mative of Commission views and judgements.
(A 287) The Commission also wishes to emphasise an important issue discussed in
Annex B (drafted by a Task Group of ICRP Committee 2) of these Recommenda-tions. The conclusions and proposals summarised in Table A.7.1 are principallyfor the broad purposes of prospective planning in radiological protection. For otherpurposes many of the proposed judgements may well be insuﬃcient, and in these cir-cumstances, speciﬁc, well-justiﬁed judgements on radiation eﬀects and their healthrisks will need to be made.ICRP Publication 103

247Preface to Annex B
When the Commission initiated its project to review and update its 1990 Recom-
mendations, at the Main Commission meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1998,it was clear from the outset that the main text of the new Recommendations would
need to be supported by scientiﬁc Annexes and reports in much the same manner as
the 1990 Recommendations.
Therefore, ICRP Committees 1 (on radiation eﬀects) and 2 (on doses from radia-
tion exposure) were asked to outline and begin to draft Annexes on the health eﬀectsof radiation and on dosimetric considerations. (Committees 3 on protection in med-icine and 4 on application of ICRP recommendations were similarly asked to producesupporting documents which were and are being published as separate reports: Pub-
lication 105 , ICRP (2007b) on protection in medicine and Publication 101 , ICRP
(2006a), on assessing dose to the representative person and on optimisation).
After initial plenary work, Committee 2 formed a Task Group in 2001 to advise
the Main Commission and draft the present Annex to the Recommendations.
The membership of the Task Group was as follows:
C. Streﬀer, Chair G. Dietze K. Eckerman
J. Harrison H. Menzel J. Stather

249ICRP Publication 103Executive summary
(B a) Dosimetric quantities are needed to assess radiation exposures to humans
and other organisms in a quantitative way. This is necessary in order to describedose–response relationships for radiation eﬀects which provide the basis for risk esti-
mation in radiological protection.
(B b) Absorbed dose, D, is the basic physical quantity for radiological protection.
It is deﬁned as the mean of the distribution of energy deposited in a tissue volume. Itis well deﬁned at any point in matter. It is measurable. In the low dose range, impor-tant for radiological protection, the distribution of energy deposition is heteroge-neous, particularly in the case of exposure to high-LET radiation. In practicalapplications, averaging of absorbed dose over organ or tissue volumes is performed.It is assumed that the mean value of absorbed dose in an organ or tissue is correlated
with radiation detriment from stochastic eﬀects in the low dose range. The averaging
of absorbed doses in tissues and organs of the human body and their weighted sumare the basis for the deﬁnition of protection quantities. Dose distributions that arehighly heterogeneous (e.g., DNA precursors labelled with tritium or Auger emitters)may need special treatment.
(B c) The deﬁnition of protection quantities is based on the mean absorbed dose,
D
T,R, in an organ or tissue T, due to radiation of type R. The protection quantity
equivalent dose, HT, is deﬁned by
HT¼X
RwRDT;R
where wRis the radiation weighting factor for radiation R. These wRvalues are based
on experimental data for the relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) of various typesof radiations at low doses, on biophysical considerations and on judgements. A set ofw
Rvalues was given in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b). The general concept of these
values remains unchanged. Some modiﬁcations are recommended: The wRvalue for
protons is reduced to a factor of 2 and a continuous function is used for neutronswith a reduction of the w
Rvalue to 2.5 at energies below 10 KeV and above 1
GeV. The principal deﬁnition of eﬀective dose,
E¼X
TwTHT
remains unchanged from Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b). However, some of the tissue
weighting factors, wT, have been changed on the basis of new epidemiological data
for cancer induction (see Annex A).
(B d) The wTvalues are age- and sex-averaged. Therefore Eis not calculated for an
individual but for a Reference Person. The Commission has now deﬁned sex-speciﬁccomputational phantoms for a Reference Male and a Reference Female. Thesephantom models will be used for calculations of dose conversion coeﬃcients forexternal exposures and dose coeﬃcients for internal exposures. The new sex-speciﬁccomputational models allow the calculation of male and female organ doses sepa-
rately, from which the averaged equivalent organ doses are calculated. These are
251ICRP Publication 103used for the calculation of E. Computational phantoms for chinldren of various ages
and the fetus will also be deﬁned. With the assumption of the linear-non-thresholddose response for stochastic radiation eﬀects (LNT model) in the low dose range(<100 mSv) and, under the conditions of the described concept of calculation, E
is an additive quantity. At higher radiation doses, when tissue reactions (determin-
istic eﬀects) can occur, the absorbed doses in organs and tissues have to be used
for risk evaluation. In the case of high-LET radiation exposures, appropriate RBEvalues relating to deterministic eﬀects should be used.
(B e) The body related protection quantities (equivalent dose and eﬀective dose)
cannot be applied directly in radiation monitoring as they are not directly measur-able. Operational quantities are measured instead for the assessment of EandH
T.
For external exposures, operational dose equivalent quantities have been deﬁnedfor area and individual monitoring. Measurements with an area monitor are prefer-
ably performed free in air, and personal dosimeters are worn on the body. The radi-
ation ﬁelds ‘seen’ by these dosimeters diﬀer and therefore diﬀerent operational dosequantities have been deﬁned. Dose equivalent quantities, based on doses to the depthof 10 mm and 0.07 mm of the ICRU sphere or in the human body respectively, havebeen recommended. Eand organ doses are calculated by dose conversion coeﬃcients
for external exposure. For dose assessment from internal exposures, the intake ofradionuclides and the resultant equivalent dose as well as the eﬀective dose are cal-culated on the basis of direct (e.g., measuring radioactivity of the whole body) or
indirect (e.g., measuring the radioactivity in excreta) measurement using biokinetic
models describing the behaviour of the radionuclide in the body.
(B f) Dose quantities in radiological protection for workers and the general public
are needed mainly for prospective dose assessment in planned exposure situationsand optimisation as well as for retrospective dose assessments for testing compliancewith dose limits. The intake of a radionuclide during a year is assigned a committedeﬀective dose. A commitment period of 50 years is considered for adults, and to age70 years for children. The annual eﬀective doses of workers and of members of the
public are the sum of the eﬀective dose obtained within one year from external expo-
sure and the committed eﬀective dose from radionuclide intake during this year.
(B g) For external exposures at workplaces usually the eﬀective dose is assigned by
measuring personal dose equivalent, Hp(10), as an acceptable assessment, assuming
uniform whole body exposure. The committed eﬀective dose from intakes of radio-nuclides is assessed by considering the ingestion and inhalation of radioactive mate-rials. Public exposures can occur from natural radiation sources and from technicalinstallations. Doses are mainly determined by environmental measurements, habit
data and modelling. The use of Efor medical exposures of patients has important
limitations, as often only parts of an organ or the human body are exposed, andthe age distribution of patients diﬀers from that of the general public; other factorsmay also need to be considered.
(B h) The primary use of Eis for demonstrating compliance with dose limits. In
that sense it serves to limit and to regulate the occurrence of stochastic eﬀects inthe low dose range, and it is used for regulatory purposes worldwide. Eis calculated
on the basis of reference values for a Reference Person. The weighting factors are
252ICRP Publication 103selected from a range of experimental and epidemiological data by judgement, and
they apply to a population of all ages and both sexes. For retrospective dose andespecially risk assessments in individual cases individual parameters such as sex,age and organ doses would need to be taken into account. Eshould not be used
for epidemiological studies. In the case of accidents that could give rise to determin-
istic eﬀects it is necessary to estimate absorbed dose and dose rates to organs and
tissues. Considerations of threshold doses are then important and, for exposuresto high-LET radiation, appropriate RBE values have to be chosen.
(B i) Collective eﬀective dose is retained as an important and useful instrument for
optimisation especially for occupational exposures. In the past, collective eﬀectivedose was frequently computed as the sum of radiation exposures over a wide rangeof doses, over long time periods and over large geographical regions. On this basisradiation-related detriments have been calculated. Such calculations are not mean-
ingful because large uncertainties are included with respect to the dose assessments
and extrapolation procedures from high and medium radiation doses to very lowdoses. To avoid the aggregation of low individual doses over extended time periods,limiting conditions have to be set. The following aspects could be considered: num-ber of exposed individuals, age and sex of exposed individuals, range of individualdoses, dose distribution in time, and geographical distribution of exposedindividuals.
(B j) For the dose assessments in radiological protection a number of models and
parameter values are necessary. These have been developed from experimental inves-
tigations and human studies in order to derive ‘best estimates’ of model parametervalues. It is recognised that in some cases there may be large uncertainties in thesevalues. Besides these uncertainties, the biological variability is high for many param-eters and therefore reference values have to be selected from a wide range of values.These reference values and models have been ﬁxed by convention and thus are pointvalues without uncertainty. They are periodically re-evaluated and may be updatedwhen new scientiﬁc data become available. The reference systems are mainly devel-
oped for prospective dose assessments in regulatory processes. For dose assessments,
and especially for risk estimates in dose ranges above the dose limits, and in individ-ual cases, uncertainties in models and parameter values may need to be taken intoconsideration.
253ICRP Publication 103B.1. Introduction
(B 1) For establishing principles and systems of radiological protection, dosimetric
quantities are needed to assess the radiation exposures of humans and other organ-isms in a quantitative way. The quantiﬁcation of radiation doses for exposed human
populations or experimental animals is also important for developing dose–response
relationships for radiation eﬀects. Such relationships are used over wider dose rangesthan those for which data are available, particularly in the low dose range, which isimportant for radiological protection.
(B 2) The development of health eﬀects caused by ionising radiation starts with the
physical processes of energy absorption in biological tissues, resulting in ionisationswhich cause molecular changes and which may occur in clusters, e.g., in the geneticinformation of cells, the DNA in the cell nucleus. This damage manifests itself as
radiation damage to the organs and tissues of the body which can result in both
short-term and long-term health eﬀects. At high doses acute damage to organsand tissues mainly arises as a result of loss of function involving cell killing and,in extreme cases, can cause death of the exposed individual. These types of damageare termed deterministic eﬀects (Publication 60 , ICRP, 1991b) or tissue reactions (see
Annex A, paragraph A 56), having previously been called non-stochastic eﬀects in
Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977) .At lower doses and at low dose rates these tissue reac-
tions are not seen, but damage to the genetic material may occur that can result in an
increase in the risk of cancer observed years later, or heritable disease in future gen-
erations. Such damage continues to be termed stochastic as the probability of the ef-
fect, but not its severity, is assumed to increase with dose.
(B 3) Other interactions with cells, organs and tissues may also be important in
understanding the response of the body to radiation exposure (for example damageto membranes), as described in Annex A. However, it is concluded that the informa-tion on the implications of other responses in terms of the observed tissue eﬀects isunclear at present, and that such eﬀects cannot at present be taken into account in
dose and risk assessments for protection purposes.
(B 4) Radiological protection is concerned with controlling exposures to ionising
radiation so that tissue reactions are prevented and the risk of stochastic eﬀects islimited to acceptable levels. For assessing doses from radiation exposures specialdosimetric quantities have been developed by ICRP and by the International Com-
mission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU). The fundamental protection
quantities adopted by ICRP are based on measures of the energy imparted to organs
and tissues of the human body. These quantities allow quantiﬁcation of the extent of
exposure to ionising radiation from both whole and partial body irradiation from
external radiation sources and from intakes of radionuclides. The estimated dosescan then be compared with recommended dose limits for people who are occupation-ally exposed and for members of the public.
(B 5) This scheme of quantities was ﬁrst adopted by the Commission in its Recom-
mendations in Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977). The quantities were modiﬁed in the 1990
Recommendations in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) and have been developed further
in the 2007 Recommendations.
255ICRP Publication 103(B 6) For demonstrating compliance with dose limits, it is useful to have a single
protection quantity specifying the ‘amount’ of whole or partial body exposure whichis quantitatively related to the probability of an eﬀect for all types of radiations,regardless of whether the radiation is incident on the body or emitted by radionuc-lides within it. Achieving this ideal is complicated by variations in the response of
organs and tissues to radiations of diﬀerent quality and by the varying radiosensitiv-
ity of the organs and tissues of the body. These eﬀects generally inﬂuence the radi-ation response of all members of the population in a similar way. Therefore theywere taken into account in the protection quantities recommended in Publication
26using quality factors and tissue weighting factors and in Publication 60 using radi-
ation and tissue weighting factors. Individually related factors including sex, age andindividual sensitivity will also inﬂuence the risk but such biological eﬀects are nottaken into account in the deﬁnition of the protection quantities, which are applied
for all members of the population.
(B 7) In Publication 26 the diﬀerent qualities of ionising radiation were considered
with the quantity dose equivalent. The dose equivalent, H, was deﬁned by
H¼DQN ðB:1:1Þ
where Dis the absorbed dose at a point in the speciﬁed tissue and Qis the quality
factor for the speciﬁc radiation at this point. Nwas included to cover any other fac-
tor that could modify the risk from a radiation dose. However, in Publication 26 no
such modifying factors were speciﬁed. Hence the deﬁnition of Hwas later changed to
H¼DQ ðB:1:2Þ
(see ICRP, 1991b, ICRU, 1993b).
(B 8) The Commission ﬁrst introduced the protection quantity, eﬀective dose equiv-
alent ,i nPublication 26 (ICRP, 1977) as proposed by Jacobi (1975). It was intended
to be used for exposure limitation and risk management at low doses and was devel-
oped principally for use in relation to occupational exposure, although it has alsobeen used more broadly for members of the public. The Commission updated thisconcept in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) with the quantity eﬀective dose . The under-
lying principle was to use the absorbed dose as the fundamental physical quantity, to
average it over speciﬁed organs and tissues and then to apply suitably chosen weight-ing factors to take account of diﬀerences in biological eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent radi-ations and the diﬀerences in radiation sensitivities of organs and tissues to stochastic
health eﬀects.
(B 9) The development of eﬀective dose equivalent and subsequently eﬀective dose
has made a very signiﬁcant contribution to radiological protection as it has enableddoses to be summed from whole and partial body exposure from external radiationand from intakes of radionuclides.
(B 10) Eﬀective dose, as deﬁned in Publication 60 , has been implemented into leg-
islation and regulations in many countries worldwide. It has been shown to provide apracticable approach to the management and limitation of radiation risk in relation
to both occupational exposures and exposures of the general public. The general
acceptance of eﬀective dose as well as the demonstration of its practicability are
256ICRP Publication 103important reasons for maintaining it as the central quantity in radiological
protection.
(B 11) Eﬀective dose cannot be measured directly in the body. The protection sys-
tem therefore includes operational quantities that can be measured (Fig. B.1) and
used to assess eﬀective dose. ICRU has developed a set of operational dose quantities
for exposure to external radiation which were evaluated by a joint Task Group of
ICRP and ICRU ( Publication 74 , ICRP, 1996b). The analysis in Publication 74 indi-
cated that the operational dose quantities recommended by ICRU generally achievethe objective of providing ‘measurable quantities that adequately represent the pro-tection quantities’. For internal exposures following intakes of radionuclides, activityquantities in combination with dose coeﬃcients developed by ICRP are also used asoperational quantities.
(B 12) There are a number of aspects to the dosimetry system given in Publication
60that needed to be addressed and further clariﬁed. This Annex considers the dosi-
metric quantities developed by ICRP for radiological protection purposes and pro-vides a detailed description of the Commission’s dosimetry system adopted in theseRecommendations. The health eﬀects resulting from exposures to ionising radiationare brieﬂy summarised in Section B.2, and their place in setting and applying protec-tion standards are described. The basis for the development of the tissue weightingfactors, w
T, is summarised although this is considered in more detail in Annex A.
Section B.3 considers the development of the dosimetric quantities and those
adopted in these Recommendations. It also examines tissue and radiation weighting
factors in more detail, with emphasis on the latter. Section B.4 describes the

tion of these dosimetric quantities in radiological protection, together with a discus-sion of situations in which the use of eﬀective dose is, or is not, appropriate iscovered in Section B.5. Finally, Section B.6 examines uncertainties and judgementsthat may need to be considered in using these quantities.

258ICRP Publication 103B.2. Health eﬀects
(B 13) Radiological protection in the low dose range is primarily concerned with
protection against radiation-induced cancer and heritable diseases. These diseasesare termed stochastic eﬀects, as they are probabilistic in nature. It is assumed that
any exposure is capable of causing an eﬀect, with no threshold (Annex A). As a con-
sequence it is not possible to prevent stochastic risks and dose limits are set to limittheir occurrence and thus to prevent unacceptable levels of risk. As indicated above,ICRP has developed the quantity eﬀective dose to allow doses from external andinternal exposure to be assessed on a common basis by using the above mentionedweighting factors.
(B 14) At exposures giving an absorbed dose above about 0.5–1 Gy (for low-LET
radiation; LET: linear energy transfer, see Section B.3.5.1), associated mainly with
accident situations, tissue reactions may occur if exposures exceed threshold doses
for such health eﬀects (Annex A). These thresholds vary with dose rate and withradiation quality, and the extent as well as the severity of the eﬀect increases withincreasing dose and dose rate. Tissue reactions must be considered separately fromstochastic eﬀects and cannot be addressed within the framework of eﬀective doseand its parameters, w
RandwT.
B.2.1. Stochastic eﬀects
(B 15) Exposure to ionising radiation, even at low doses, may cause damage to the
nuclear (genetic) material in cells that may result in the development of radiation-induced cancer many years later, heritable disease in future generations and somedevelopmental eﬀects under certain conditions (ICRP, 2003a). The induction of can-cer by low-LET radiation has been ﬁrmly demonstrated in the dose range of about100 mGy and higher, and it was concluded by UNSCEAR that ‘studies on DNA re-pair and the cellular/molecular processes of radiation tumorigenesis provide no good
reason to assume that there will be a low-dose threshold for the induction of tumours
in general’ (UNSCEAR, 2000). Radiation-induced heritable disease has not beendemonstrated in human populations but there is substantial evidence from animalstudies of heritable damage to germ cells (ova and spermatozoa as well as their pre-cursor cells). For both radiation-induced cancer and heritable disease it is the prob-ability of the occurrence of the eﬀect, not its severity, that depends upon the dose.The general assumption for radiological protection is that the risk of these stochasticeﬀects increases in the low dose range linearly with dose, with no threshold (LNT
model) (UNSCEAR, 2000, Streﬀer et al., 2004, Annex A).
(B 16) Annex A gives detailed information on the risk of radiation-induced cancer
in organs and tissues of the body and on dose–response relationships as well as ofheritable disease. It is notable that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in sensitivity tocancer induction among the organs and tissues of the body. Thus, for example,the thyroid in children, the female breast and the bone marrow have a relatively highsensitivity for the induction of solid cancer and leukaemia whereas the muscle andconnective tissue have a relatively low sensitivity.
259ICRP Publication 103(B 17) Annex A also gives information on other stochastic eﬀects that may occur
following radiation exposure. This includes damage to the vascular tissue of the cir-culatory system of blood. At present, however, insuﬃcient data are available todetermine any dose–response relationships in the dose range below about 0.5 to 1Gy or to use them as a basis for setting dose limits.
(B 18) A central position of the Recommendations in Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977)
was that the overall risk of stochastic eﬀects at exposures corresponding to the Com-mission’s dose limits are approximately equal, regardless of the manner of irradia-tion – whether the body is uniformly or heterogeneously irradiated from externalradiation or from intakes of radionuclides if the sensitivity to the diﬀerent types ofradiation are correctly considered. This principle resulted in the inclusion of twotypes of weighting factors in the deﬁnition of eﬀective dose equivalent for use inradiological protection.
(B 19) The quality factors, ﬁrst used in Publication 6 (ICRP, 1964), allowed for the
relative eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent radiations in causing biological eﬀects and could bethought of as the factor representing the relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) of theradiation. Experimental measurements of RBE in cellular studies in vitro, and in ani-mal studies, show that high-LET radiations, including neutrons and alpha particles,cause more damage per unit of absorbed dose than low-LET radiations. The weight-ing factors, w
T(later termed tissue weighting factors in Publication 60 ) accounted for
the varying radiation sensitivity of tissues to the induction of stochastic eﬀects.
(B 20) The wTvalues recommended by the Commission in Publication 26 were
based on the risk of fatal cancer and of serious heritable disease in the ﬁrst two gen-erations (Table B.1). Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) developed this concept further
with an extended set of tissue weighting factors based upon more information on sto-chastic radiation eﬀects on tissues and a broader concept of radiation detriment. Inaddition to assessing the risk of radiation-induced fatal cancer and heritable diseasein all future generations it also took into account the severity of the disease and theyears of life lost in determining total radiation detriment. Radiation detriment then
provided the basis for setting revised values of tissue weighting factors, w
T,i nPub-
lication 60 (Table 1). In addition, radiation weighting factors, wR, replaced quality
factors, Q, in the deﬁnition of the protection quantities. The assumption was made
that, for protection purposes, the weighting factors are independent of dose and doserate in the low dose range. Values of w
Rare taken to be independent of the organ or
tissue irradiated and wTvalues to be independent of the type and energy of radiation.
(B 21) In the 2007 Recommendations, the Commission has further developed the
concept of tissue weighting factors, and now bases values of wTto a large extent on
the incidence of radiation-induced cancer rather than on mortality as well as on the
risk of heritable disease over the ﬁrst two generations (Annex A). This is consideredto be a more appropriate basis for the assessment of radiation detriment. The risk ofcancer is again adjusted for severity and for years of life lost. The tissue weightingfactors given in the 2007 Recommendations are presented in Table B.2 and discussedfurther in Section B.3.5, paragraphs B 132 – B 145.

261ICRP Publication 103B.2.2. Tissue reactions (deterministic eﬀects)
(B 22) At doses much higher than the dose limits recommended in the protection
system, and especially in accident situations, radiation exposures may cause deter-
ministic eﬀects (tissue reactions). These eﬀects result from the impairment of the
integrity and function of organs and tissues: clinically observable damage then oc-
curs above a threshold dose, although the extent of any damage depends upon theabsorbed dose and dose rate as well as radiation quality. The expression of injuryvaries from one tissue or organ to another depending upon cellular radiosensitivity,the function of diﬀerentiated cells, cellular composition, and cell renewal capacity.Loss of reproductive capacity of cells, the development of ﬁbrotic processes and celldeath play a central role in the pathogenesis of most tissue reactions. Some of themost sensitive tissues, with respect to early tissue reactions, are those with rapidly
proliferating cell systems including haematopoietic tissue, the cells lining the gastro-
intestinal tract, the basal cell layer in the skin, and the male germ cells. Late tissuereactions may also depend in part on damage to blood vessels or connective tissueelements that are essential for the functioning of all organs and tissues as well asof the lens of the eye. Such damage can be expressed many months or even yearsafter radiation exposure.
(B 23) High-LET radiations, such as neutrons and alpha particles, cause more
damage per unit of absorbed dose than low-LET radiation. Values of RBE for tissue
reactions were given in Publication 58 (ICRP, 1989b). In general the RBE values
were found to be lower for tissue reactions than those for stochastic eﬀects at lowdoses and to vary with the tissue damage described.
(B 24) The radiation weighting factors, w
R, for high-LET radiation are derived
for stochastic eﬀects at low doses. The application of these wRvalues to assess
the exposure and damage at high doses, when compared with photon irradiation,would result in an over-estimate of the occurrence and severity of any tissue reac-tion. When assessing radiation exposure for determining the potential for tissue
reactions, the mean absorbed dose to the organ or tissue, weighted by an appropri-
ate value of RBE for the biological end point of concern, should therefore be used.These RBE values may diﬀer for diﬀerent biological endpoints and diﬀerent tissuesor organs. Guidance on appropriate values of the RBE can be obtained in Publica-
tion 58 (ICRP 1989b), NCRP Report No. 104 (1990) and Publication 92 (ICRP,
2003c).
(B 25) As a consequence, the quantities, equivalent dose and eﬀective dose, with
their unit with the special name sievert (Sv), should not be used in the quantiﬁcation
of radiation doses or in determining the need for any treatment in situations where
tissue reactions are caused. In general, in such cases doses should be given in terms ofabsorbed dose in gray (Gy), and if high-LET radiations (e.g., neutrons or alphaparticles) are involved, an RBE-weighted dose, RBE ÆD(Gy), may be used. The
RBE value to be considered depends, however, not only on the type and energy ofthe particles involved but also may depend on dose and dose rate in the speciﬁcsituation and on the tissue as well as organs. In such cases it is necessary to clearlystate which RBE value has been applied.

263ICRP Publication 103B.3. Quantities in radiological protection
(B 26) Radiological protection has the general aim of protecting humans and the
environment from harm caused by ionising radiation after external as well as internalexposures. This requires a quantitative description of the radiation ﬁelds external to
and internal within the human body. Similar considerations apply to protection of
other biological organisms. This latter aspect will not be considered further in thisAnnex.
(B 27) While radiation ﬁelds external to the body can be well described by physical
quantities such as particle ﬂuence or air kerma free in air, the internal radiation ﬁeldsfollowing the intake of radionuclides depend upon their biokinetics and on anatom-ical and physiological parameters of the human body.
(B 28) Fluence is a quantity used to describe external radiation ﬁelds. It is not,
however, practicable for general use in radiological protection and the deﬁnition
of limits. Fluence always needs the additional speciﬁcation of the particle and parti-cle energy as well as direction distributions. Its correlation with detriment iscomplex.
(B 29) As mentioned in the Introduction, in radiological protection practice, a sin-
gle quantity has been developed for specifying the ‘amount’ of exposure which isquantitatively related to the probability of stochastic eﬀects in human bodies forall types of radiations regardless of which type of ionising radiation is considered
or whether the radiation is incident on the body or emitted by radionuclides within
the body. It needs to be stressed that this is a practical protection quantity that in-volves parameter values that are based on judgement.
(B 30) The initial step in the interaction of ionising radiation with biological mate-
rial is energy transfer that leads to ionisations. It might appear reasonable to use theamount of absorbed energy per unit of mass (absorbed dose) as the only term forquantifying the radiation exposure in radiological protection in order to estimatethe risk caused by a given exposure. This is not suﬃcient, however, as radiation ef-
fects depend not only on the absorbed dose but also on the type of radiation, on the
distribution of energy absorption in time and space within the human body, and onthe radiosensitivity of the exposed tissues or organs.
(B 31) The basic procedure of dose assessment adopted by the Commission is to
useabsorbed dose as the fundamental physical quantity, to average it over speciﬁed
organs and tissues, and to apply suitably chosen weighting factors to take account ofdiﬀerences in biological eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent radiations and of diﬀerences in sen-sitivities of organs and tissues to stochastic health eﬀects. Eﬀective dose is therefore a
quantity based on the internal and external radiation ﬁelds and the primary physical
interactions in human tissues as well as on judgements about the biological reactionsresulting in stochastic health eﬀects.
B.3.1. Fluence and kerma
(B 32) A radiation ﬁeld of a speciﬁc type is fully described by the number Nof
particles, their distributions in energy and direction, and their spatial and temporal
265ICRP Publication 103distribution. This requires the deﬁnition of scalar and vector quantities. Deﬁnitions
of radiation ﬁeld quantities are given in detail in ICRU Report 60 (1998). While vec-tor quantities providing information on direction distributions are mainly applied inradiation transport theory and calculations, scalar quantities such as particle ﬂuenceor kerma are often used in dosimetry applications.
(B 33) Radiation ﬁeld quantities are deﬁned at any point in a radiation ﬁeld.
There are two classes of radiation ﬁeld quantities referring either to the number ofparticles, such as ﬂuence and ﬂuence rate, or to the energy transported by them, suchas energy ﬂuence. Radiation ﬁelds may consist of various types of radiation, andthose ﬁeld quantities which are based on particle numbers are always related to aspeciﬁc type. This is often expressed by adding the particle name to the quantity,e.g., neutron ﬂuence.
(B 34) The quantity ﬂuence is based on the concept of counting the number of par-
ticles incident or passing a small sphere.
(B 35) The ﬂuence ,U, is the quotient of d Nby da, where d Nis the number of par-
ticles incident upon a small sphere of cross-sectional area d a, thus
U¼
dN
daðB:3:1Þ
The ﬂuence is independent of the direction distribution of the particles entering the
sphere. In calculations, ﬂuence is often alternatively expressed in terms of the lengthof trajectories of particles passing through a small volume d V. The ﬂuence, U, is then
given by
U¼dl
dVðB:3:2Þ
where d lis the sum of the lengths of trajectories through this volume d V.
(B 36) In radiation ﬁelds the number of particles traversing a small sphere is al-
ways subject to random ﬂuctuations. However, ﬂuence – as well as related quantities– is deﬁned as a non-stochastic quantity and hence has a single value at a given point
and time with no inherent ﬂuctuations. Its value should be considered as an expec-
tation value.
(B 37) The transfer of energy from uncharged particles (indirectly ionising parti-
cles, e.g., photons or neutrons) to matter is performed by the liberation and slowingdown of secondary charged particles in this matter. This led to the deﬁnition of thequantity kerma. The kerma ,K, is the quotient of d E
trby dm, where d Etris the sum of
the kinetic energies of all charged particles liberated by uncharged particles in a massdmof material. It is given by:
K¼dEtr
dmðB:3:3Þ
(B 38) The SI unit of kerma is J kg/C01and its special name is gray (Gy). Kerma is a
non-stochastic quantity in which d Etris seen to be the expectation value of the sum
of energies of liberated charged particles.
266ICRP Publication 103B.3.2. Absorbed dose
(B 39) In radiation biology, clinical radiology and radiological protection the ab-
sorbed dose, D, is the basic physical dose quantity. It is used for all types of ionising
radiation and any irradiation geometry.
(B 40) Absorbed dose, D, is deﬁned as the quotient of d /C22e,b yd m, where d /C22eis the
mean energy imparted to matter of mass d mby ionising radiation, that is
D¼d/C22e
dmðB:3:4Þ
The SI unit is J kg/C01and its special name is gray (Gy). While the value of kerma de-
pends only on interactions in the material of mass element d m, the value of absorbed
dose also depends on the secondary charged particles which are released in the sur-roundings of the mass element d mand which enter this element. Absorbed dose is
derived from the mean value of the stochastic quantity of energy imparted, e,a n d
does not reﬂect the random ﬂuctuations of the interaction events in tissue. Whileit is deﬁned at any point in matter, its value is obtained as an average over d m
and hence over many atoms or molecules of matter.
(B 41) The deﬁnition of absorbed dose has the scientiﬁc rigour required for a basic
physical quantity. It implicitly takes account of the radiation ﬁeld as well as of all ofits interactions with matter inside and outside the speciﬁed volume. It does not, how-ever, take account of the atomic structure of matter and the stochastic nature of theinteractions. Absorbed dose is a measurable quantity and primary standards exist toallow its determination by measurement.
(B 42) A particular feature of ionising radiations is their discontinuous interaction
with matter and the related stochastic (probabilistic) nature of energy deposition.
Energy is transferred to the tissue by charged particles in interactions with individual
atoms and molecules. The human body is made up of organs and tissues, which con-sist of cells, sub-cellular structures and macromolecules such as DNA. Absorbeddose is deﬁned as the mean of the stochastic distribution of energy deposited in a vol-ume element. The ﬂuctuations of energy deposited in individual cells and sub-cellularstructures and the microscopic tracks of charged particles are the subject ofmicrodosimetry .
(B 43) The magnitude of the ﬂuctuations of energy deposited in diﬀerent small tis-
sue volumes depends on the value of the absorbed dose and on the size of the volume
considered. At a given dose, these ﬂuctuations increase with increasing ionisationdensity in charged particle tracks (characterised by the l
inear e nergy t ransfer,
LET, see Section B.3.5, paragraphs B 73 – B 131) of the radiation. At the low ab-sorbed doses generally of concern in radiological protection, the statistical ﬂuctua-tion of energy deposited can be substantial between individual cells and within asingle hit cell. This is the case particularly for densely ionising radiations (high-LET radiation) such as alpha particles and secondary charged particles from neutron
interactions.
(B 44) At a given absorbed dose, the actual value of energy imparted, e, in a small
tissue volume, e.g., in a single cell, is given by the sum of energies deposited in that
267ICRP Publication 103volume by all individual events. In any volume, ﬂuctuations of eare caused by var-
iation in the number of events and by variation in the energy deposited in each event.For low-LET radiations (e.g., photons and electrons) the energy imparted in eachevent (hit) is relatively low, and at low doses more cells experience energy depositionevents than in the case of exposure to high-LET radiation at the same dose. As a
consequence, the ﬂuctuation in the energy deposited among cells is smaller for
low-LET than for high-LET radiation.
(B 45) (B 45) For low mean doses of high-LET radiation (e.g., charged particles
from neutron interactions or alpha particles), the frequency of hits in most cells iszero, in a few it is one and exceptionally it can be more than one. The value of energydeposited in most individual cells is then zero but in the ‘hit’ cells it can exceed themean value (i.e., absorbed dose) in the tissue by orders of magnitude. Even amongthe hit cells the distribution of these events is very heterogeneous. These large diﬀer-
ences in the energy deposition distribution in microscopic regions for diﬀerent types
(and energies) of radiation have been correlated to observed diﬀerences in biologicaleﬀectiveness or radiation quality (Goodhead, 1994). Further information is given,for example, in the UNSCEAR 1993 and 2000 reports (UNSCEAR, 1993; 2000).
(B 46) Auger electrons emitted from radionuclides in the body need special atten-
tion if such emitters are in or near to the DNA. Often a radionuclide, which decaysvia internal conversion, emits many Auger electrons. These emissions can result in avery localised energy deposition, and the biological eﬀect may, therefore, be similar
to that of a high-LET radiation. This has already been considered in Publication 60
(ICRP, 1991b); see Section B.3.5., paragraphs B 86 – B 99).
(B 47) In the deﬁnition of radiological protection quantities no attempts are made
to specify the stochastic distribution of physical processes at a microscopic level. In-stead of explicitly considering such distribution functions, a pragmatic and empiricalapproach has been adopted to take account of radiation quality diﬀerences. Radia-tion weighting factors take into account the eﬀects due to diﬀerences in distributionof energy deposited in microscopic regions through judgements based on the results
of radiobiological experiments. This is discussed in more detail in Section B.3.5,
paragraphs B 73 – B 131.
B.3.3. Averaging of absorbed dose
(B 48) As described above, the quantity absorbed dose is deﬁned to give a speciﬁc
value at any point in matter. However, in practical applications absorbed doses areoften averaged over larger tissue volumes. It is thus assumed that, for low doses, the
mean value of absorbed dose in a speciﬁc organ or tissue can be correlated with radi-
ation detriment from stochastic eﬀects in all parts of that organ or tissue with suﬃ-cient accuracy for the purposes of radiological protection.
(B 49) The mean absorbed dose in the region of an organ or tissue T,
DT, is deﬁned
by

268ICRP Publication 103where Vis the volume of the tissue region T, Dthe absorbed dose at a point ( x,y,z)i n
that region and qthe mass density at this point. In practice, the mean absorbed dose
in an organ or tissue T, DT, is usually written DT.
(B 50) The averaging of absorbed doses in diﬀerent tissues or organs of the human
body and their weighted sum are the basis for the deﬁnition of the protection quan-
tities which are used for limiting stochastic eﬀects at low doses. This approach is
based upon the assumption of a linear-non-threshold, dose–response relationship(LNT model) and allows the addition of doses from external and internal exposure.This concept is considered to be an acceptable approximation for radiological pro-tection purposes and was ﬁrst adopted by the Commission in Publication 9 (ICRP,
1966). It was subsequently reaﬃrmed in later Recommendations including Publica-
tions 26 and60(ICRP, 1977, 1991b) and is further supported in Annex A of the pres-
ent Recommendations. The deﬁnitions of all the protection quantities rely on this
fundamental assumption of the LNT model in the low-dose region.
(B 51) The averaging of absorbed dose is carried out over the volume of a speciﬁed
organ (e.g., liver) or tissue (e.g., muscle) or a region of a tissue (e.g., endosteal sur-faces of the skeleton, skin). The extent to which the mean absorbed dose (Eqn. B.3.5)is representative of the local absorbed dose throughout organs, tissues, or tissue re-gions depends on a number of factors. For external radiation exposure, this dependsmainly on the homogeneity of the exposure and on the penetrability or range of theincident radiation in the body. For penetrating radiation (photons, neutrons) the ab-
sorbed dose distribution within most organs may be suﬃciently homogeneous, and
thus the mean absorbed dose is a suitable measure of the dose throughout the organor tissue.
(B 52) The absorbed dose distribution within the speciﬁed organ or tissue may be
very heterogeneous for radiation with low penetration or limited range (low-energyphotons, charged particles) as well as for widely distributed tissues and organs (e.g.,active [red] bone marrow or lymphatic nodes) in non-homogeneous radiation ﬁelds.In cases of extreme partial body exposure tissue damage may occur even if the mean
tissue or organ dose or the eﬀective dose is below the dose limit. For example, this
may occur in the case of exposure of the skin to low-penetrating radiation. A speciallimit is applied to local skin dose to avoid tissue reactions (see Section B.5.5).
(B 53) For radiations emitted by radionuclides retained within body organs or
tissues, so-called internal emitters, the absorbed dose distribution in the organsdepends on the distribution of the radionuclides and the penetration and range ofthe radiations emitted. It also depends on the structure of the organ or tissue(e.g., ‘walled’ organs such as the urinary bladder, airways of the respiratory tract,
and the highly heterogeneous mixture of bone mineral, inactive and active bone mar-
row). The absorbed dose distribution for radionuclides emitting alpha particles, softbeta particles, low-energy photons, or Auger electrons may be highly heterogeneous.
(B 54) This heterogeneity occurs in particular in the case of radionuclides depos-
ited in the respiratory tract (e.g., radon decay products on the bronchial mucosa),passing through the alimentary tract, or deposited on bone surfaces (e.g., plutoniumand related elements) or on skin. In such situations the mean absorbed dose averagedover the entire organ or tissue is not considered to be an appropriate dose quantity
269ICRP Publication 103for estimating the probability of stochastic damage. The Commission has addressed
this issue and has developed dosimetric models for the respiratory system (ICRP,1994a), the alimentary tract (ICRP, 2006c), and the skeleton (ICRP, 1979) that takeaccount of the distribution of radionuclides and the location of sensitive cells in thecalculation of mean absorbed dose to these tissues. In these cases the dose deter-
mined in the identiﬁed tissue region considered to be the target for the development
of radiation-induced cancer is treated as the average dose.
(B 55) As discussed above, the heterogeneous distribution of energy deposition is of
concern with respect to the averaging procedure in the low dose range and especiallywith radionuclides which are heterogeneously distributed in an organ or tissues andwhich emit particles with short ranges. However, no established approaches are pres-ently available for use in radiological protection practice which take into accountmicrodosimetric considerations or the three-dimensional track structure in tissues
and the related energy deposition. Considering the stochastic nature of the induction
of cancer and of heritable disease and the assumptions that one single track of ionis-ing particles may be suﬃcient for the initiation process, it appears that the present ap-proach is pragmatic for radiological protection purposes with a justiﬁed scientiﬁcbasis. The uncertainty associated with such an approach should be kept in mind.
(B 56) In the case of deposition of ‘hot particles’ in the lung or other tissues, (e.g.,
aerosols deposited in the lung with low solubility and high speciﬁc activity) the Com-mission continues to consider that the associated hazard of malignant disease induc-
tion is similar to or lower than that from homogenous distribution of equal activity
in the lungs (Lafuma et al., 1974, ICRP, 1980, Charles et al., 2003).
(B 57) Dose distributions that are highly heterogeneous can result from the incor-
poration of DNA precursors labelled with tritium (e.g., thymidine, deoxycytidine) orAuger emitters incorporated into DNA in cell nuclei. Owing to the speciﬁc locationof the emitter and the very short range of tritium beta radiation and Auger electrons,cell nuclei can be exposed to doses which are much higher than the mean dose to thecell or the organ or tissue. Tritiated DNA precursors may therefore be more radio-
toxic than tritiated compounds, such as tritiated water, which are not speciﬁcally lo-
cated in the cell nucleus (Streﬀer et al., 1978). In such cases, risks might be estimatedon the basis of dose to cell nuclei. Another approach is to take account of experimen-tal mammalian data on the relative biological eﬀectiveness of heterogeneously dis-tributed radionuclides (e.g., tritiated thymidine) compared with the same nuclidesdistributed more uniformly (e.g., tritiated water) (Streﬀer et al., 1978) or with exter-nal irradiation. The Commission is not proposing a speciﬁc scheme for the treatmentof doses and risks from such localised nuclear irradiation (see Section B.3.5, para-
graphs B 86 – B 99).
B.3.4. Equivalent dose and eﬀective dose
(B 58) The protection quantities are used to specify dose limits to ensure that the
occurrence of stochastic health eﬀects is kept below unacceptable levels and tissuereactions are avoided. The system of protection quantities is shown in Figs B.1
270ICRP Publication 103and B.2. Their deﬁnition is based on the mean absorbed dose, DT;R, in the volume of
a speciﬁed organ or tissue, T, due to the radiation of type R – or in another speciﬁedtarget region of the body – (see Eqn. B.3.5). The radiation R is given by the type andenergy of radiation either incident on the body or emitted by radionuclides residingwithin the body.

inPublication 60 (ICRP, 1991b); cf. Table B.3. The general concept of these radia-
tion weighting factors remains unchanged. Some modiﬁcations to the values of wR

(B 61) While absorbed dose in a speciﬁed tissue is a physical quantity, the equiv-
alent dose and eﬀective dose include weighting factors which are based on radio-Table B.3. Radiation weighting factors1(ICRP 1991b).

272ICRP Publication 103biological and epidemiological ﬁndings. These weighting factors are selected for
application in radiological protection by judgement and include acceptable simpli-ﬁcations (see Section B.3.5). Therefore the deﬁnition and the value of eﬀective doseare not based on physical properties only. For example, the tissue weighting fac-tors, w
T, are based on epidemiological studies of cancer induction as well as on
experimental genetic data after radiation exposure, and on judgements. Further-
more they represent mean values for humans, averaged over both sexes and allages.
(B 62) The deﬁnition of the eﬀective dose is based on the mean doses in organs or
tissues of the human body. The quantity provides a value which takes account of thegiven exposure situation but not, however, the characteristics of a speciﬁc individual.For internal exposure of humans, for example, the organ doses are often determinedby assessing the intake of incorporated radionuclides and applying dose coeﬃcients
which relate the intake of activity to the corresponding mean organ doses. These
coeﬃcients are calculated using general biokinetic models and reference phantoms.Hence this means that, for a given incorporated activity of a speciﬁc radionuclide,the corresponding eﬀective dose is estimated. This approximation of the dose isjudged to be acceptable for radiological protection purposes.
(B 63) The use of eﬀective dose allows exposures in very diﬀerent situations (e.g.,
internal and external exposure by diﬀerent types of radiation) to be combined in asingle value. As a consequence, the primary exposure limits can be expressed in terms
of a single quantity. This facilitates the system of dose limitation and record-keeping.
(B 64) In order to provide a practicable approach for the assessment of eﬀective
dose, coeﬃcients relating it to physical quantities, e.g., particle ﬂuence or air kermafor external exposure or activity intake for internal exposure, are calculated for stan-dard conditions (e.g., mono-energetic radiations, standard irradiation geometries, se-lected chemical compounds labelled with radionuclides, models for the transfer ofradionuclides in the body) in anthropomorphic phantoms with clearly deﬁned geom-etries. These phantoms include most organs and tissues in the body, especially those
listed in the table of the tissue weighting factors (Table B.2).
(B 65) In the Commission’s publications since Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977), the
calculation of eﬀective dose (or eﬀective dose equivalent) from external radiationand from radionuclides incorporated into the body has been based on the equivalentdose to organs and tissues derived from sex-invariant anatomical and biokineticmodels weighted by the sex-averaged tissue weighting factors (ICRP, 1994b). Thescheme of calculation has now changed further with the development of male andfemale phantoms (Section B.5.2).
(B 66) For the calculation of conversion coeﬃcients relating eﬀective dose to radi-
ation ﬁeld quantities (for external radiation exposure situations), e.g., air kerma orparticle ﬂuence, ICRP departed from this approach in Publication 74 (ICRP,
1996b), as sex-speciﬁc anatomical models were used. The following formula withsex-speciﬁc equivalent doses in organs and tissues for the calculation of eﬀective dosewas applied in Publication 74 :
273ICRP Publication 103E¼wbreastHbreast ;female þX
T6¼breastwTHT;maleþHT;female
2/C20/C21
ðB:3:8Þ
where the summation includes the dose to the gonads (ovaries in the female, testes in
the male). The diﬀerent procedures (using sex speciﬁc or hermaphrodite models),
however, yield values of eﬀective dose which are not very diﬀerent and are suﬃcientlyprecise for applications in radiological protection.
(B 67) The Commission has deﬁned adult male and female computational phan-
toms (see Section B.5.2). These models will be used for calculations of dose conver-sion coeﬃcients for external and of dose coeﬃcients for internal radiationexposures. The use of sex-speciﬁc computational models allows the calculation ofthe male and female organ doses from which the averaged equivalent dose is calcu-
lated and used for the calculation of the eﬀective dose. This can be done for the
doses to the breast and the gonads in the same way as with the other organs andtissues.
(B 68) The procedure adopted to determine the tissue weighting factors is to ﬁrst
assess the risks of radiation-induced stochastic eﬀects in males and females sepa-rately, then calculate sex speciﬁc radiation detriment and from these values givesex-averaged w
Tvalues (Annex A). The sex-averaged wTvalues, as well as the sex-
averaged organ and tissue doses, are then used for the calculation of the eﬀective
dose (Fig. B.3). Under these conditions it is not reasonable to treat the contribution
of the male and female doses separately in the calculation of eﬀective dose. All tissuescan be treated according to Eqn. (B.3.9).

This equation together with the new female and male reference phantoms (see Sec-
tion B.5.2 and Figs B.2 and B.3) will be used for the future calculation of conversioncoeﬃcients and dose coeﬃcients.
(B 70) For practical use, the calculation of organ doses or conversion coeﬃcients
in cases of external exposures and of dose coeﬃcients (dose per intake, Sv Bq
/C01)i n
cases of internal exposures is not based on data from individual persons but on ref-erence values for the human body given in Publication 89 (ICRP, 2002). In addition,
age-speciﬁc data, e.g., food consumption etc., may need to be considered for assess-
ment of exposures for members of the public. The use of reference values and theaveraging over both sexes in the calculation of eﬀective dose indicates that the refer-ence dose coeﬃcients are not aimed at providing a dose for a speciﬁc individual butfor a Reference Person. Reference computational phantoms for children of variousages will also be developed for use in the calculation of dose coeﬃcients for membersof the public.
B.3.5. Weighting factors
(B 71) As noted previously, mean absorbed dose is insuﬃcient, on its own, for
assessing detriment caused by ionising radiation exposure. In order to establish acorrelation between dose quantities applied in radiological protection and stochasticeﬀects (radiation-induced cancer and heritable diseases), two types of weighting fac-tors have been introduced, a radiation weighting factor, w
R, and a tissue weighting
factor, wT.
(B 72) The weighting factors are intended to take account of diﬀerent types of
radiation and of stochastic eﬀects in diﬀerent organs and tissues of the body. Theyare therefore broadly based on a wide range of experimental data and epidemiolog-ical studies and they are taken to be independent of age and sex. In Publication 60
(ICRP, 1991b) the Commission selected a general set of these weighting factors thatwere considered to be appropriate for the needs of radiological protection (Tables 1and 3). This procedure is maintained in these 2007 Recommendations.
Radiation weighting factors
(B 73) The method of radiation weighting in the deﬁnition of radiological protec-
tion quantities has been used since the early 1960s. Before 1991, this was achieved byapplying the quality factor concept using a speciﬁed Q(L) function (ICRP, 1977). In
Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), radiation weighting was deﬁned diﬀerently for the
275ICRP Publication 103protection quantities and for the operational dose quantities used in measurements
of external exposure.
(B 74) Radiation weighting is based mainly on an evaluation of the relative biolog-
ical eﬀectiveness (RBE) of the diﬀerent radiations with respect to stochastic eﬀects.The RBE is used in radiobiology for characterising the diﬀerent biological eﬀective-
ness of radiations. RBE values are given as the ratio of the absorbed doses of
two types of radiation producing the same speciﬁed biological eﬀect in identicalirradiation conditions (dose value of a reference radiation divided by the correspond-ing dose value of the considered radiation which causes the same level of eﬀect).
(B 75) RBE values for a speciﬁc radiation depend upon the conditions of exposure
including the biological eﬀect investigated, the tissue or cell type involved, the doseand the dose rate, and the dose fractionation scheme; therefore, for a given type andenergy of radiation, there will be a range of RBE values. The RBEs reach maximum
values (RBE
M) at low doses and low dose rates. RBE Mis therefore of particular
interest for deﬁning radiation weighting factors for use in radiological protection.The weighting factors are taken to be independent of the dose and dose rate inthe low-dose region.
(B 76) The concepts of the quality factor and radiation weighting are based on dif-
ferences in the biological eﬀectiveness of the various types of radiation which havetheir origin in the diﬀerences of their energy deposition properties along the tracksof charged particles. For applications in radiological protection, the complex struc-
ture of the charged particle tracks in tissue is characterised by a single parameter
only, the unrestricted linear energy transfer, L
1, (often denoted linear energy trans-
fer,LET orL), and the quality factor Qis deﬁned by a function of Las given in var-
ious publications of ICRP and ICRU (ICRP, 1963, 1977, 1991b, ICRU, 1970, 1986)– for more details, see Section B.4.2.
(B 77) Another feature of the energy transfer of low- and high-LET particles is the
diﬀerence in the event distribution as has already been mentioned and discussed inSection B.3.2. This eﬀect inﬂuences their biological eﬀectiveness.
(B 78) Radiation weighting factors, w
R, have been speciﬁed in the deﬁnition of the
protection quantities since Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b). They are factors by which
the mean absorbed dose in any tissue or organ is multiplied to account for the det-riment caused by the diﬀerent types of radiation relative to photon radiation.Numerical values of w
Rare speciﬁed in terms of type and energy of radiations either
incident on the human body or emitted by radionuclides residing within it. Values ofw
Radopted in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) are given in Table B.3.
(B 79) The same values of the radiation weighting factors, wR, are applied to all
tissues and organs of the body, independent of the fact that the actual radiation ﬁeld
varies owing to attenuation and degradation of the primary radiation and the pro-duction of secondary radiations of diﬀerent radiation quality. The value of w
R
may therefore be seen as a factor representing radiation quality averaged over the
diﬀerent tissues and organs of the body.
(B 80) The averaging procedure implied in the determination of wRhas raised
some concern, especially in the case of external low-energy neutron radiation expo-sure where secondary photons (low-LET radiation) contribute signiﬁcantly to tissue
276ICRP Publication 103and organ doses (Dietze and Alberts, 2004). Therefore the mean radiation quality in
a tissue or organ exposed to low-energy neutrons depends on its position in the bodyand varies with the direction of incidence on the body.
(B 81) This problem of bi-locality of specifying radiation quality and absorbed
dose is discussed in detail in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c). That report proposes
how to achieve an improved radiation weighting factor for high-LET particles,
and a modiﬁed function is given. A ﬁxed relationship is proposed between the radi-ation weighting factor and a mean quality factor averaged over the human body andcalculated for isotropic exposure. The present 2007 Recommendations do not, how-ever, fully follow the procedure proposed in Publication 92 . Details are given in Sec-
tion B.3.5, paragraphs B 100 – B 115.
(B 82) Ideally the determination of w
Rvalues would be predominantly based on
RBE data from in-vivo investigations related to stochastic eﬀects. Often cancer
and leukaemia induction or life shortening after whole-body exposure has been
determined. While in-vitro investigations with cells can provide important contribu-tions to the understanding of basic mechanisms regarding carcinogenesis, the RBEvalues obtained in such studies may not be well correlated with carcinogenesis inhumans. In many cases, however, there are only limited data available from in-vivoinvestigations on animals for the range of radiation qualities of interest in radiolog-ical protection. Therefore the Q(L) function which is mainly based on data from
in-vitro experiments (NCRP, 1990) is used where necessary as the basis of the
calculation of a mean Q-value for the human body which in turn is then used for
estimating radiation weighting factor values. This is especially the case for protonsand heavy ions, and to some extent for neutrons (ICRP, 2003c).
(B 83) Generally, a broad range of RBE values has been obtained in investigations
of various biological eﬀects which do not exhibit a direct relationship to the eﬀectsfor which radiation weighting factors are required. Experimentally determinedRBE values are often associated with large uncertainties due, for example, to thesmall numbers of animals used and many other inﬂuencing factors. The weighting
factors are selected to give a representative value for the known data and to be suf-
ﬁciently accurate for application in radiological protection. The values of w
Rare se-
lected by judgement for use in the determination of protection quantities; as suchthey have ﬁxed values and are not associated with any uncertainty (see Section B.6).
(B 84) Reference radiation. Values of RBE obtained experimentally depend on the
reference radiation chosen. Generally, low-LET radiation is taken as the reference,and mostly
60Co- or137Cs-gamma rays or high-energy x rays, >200 kV, have been
used in experimental investigations. There exists, however, no international agree-
ment on the choice of a speciﬁc photon type or energy as a general reference radia-
tion. Therefore, for all RBE-related studies, information on the reference radiationused is needed.
(B 85) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) the Commission adopted a radiation
weighting factor of 1 for all photons (Table B.3). This is also proposed in Publication
92(ICRP, 2003c) and is consistent with the fact that no speciﬁc photon energy has
been ﬁxed as a reference. An average of RBE data related to photons of diﬀerentenergies is judged to be most appropriate for establishing w
Rvalues for radiation
277ICRP Publication 103protection. This approach does not, however, imply that no diﬀerences exist with re-
spect to the biological eﬀectiveness of photons of diﬀerent energy (see Section B.3.5,paragraphs B 86 – B 99).
(B 86) Radiation weighting factors for photons, electrons, and muons. Photons, elec-
trons, and muons are low-LET radiations with LET-values of less than 10 keV/ lm.
Low-LET radiations have always been given a radiation weighting of one. Before
1991 this was achieved by setting Q(L) = 1 for L< 3.5 keV/ lm.Publication 60
(ICRP, 1991b) deﬁned w
R= 1 for these radiations, and Q(L) = 1 for L< 10 keV/
lm for operational dose quantities (see Eqn. B.4.2). This has been decided mainly
for practical reasons but also in consideration of the large uncertainties in estimatingradiation risk factors which did not justify a more detailed description.
(B 87) Details on published RBE values for low-LET radiation are presented in
Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c), and the consequences with respect to the weighting
of photon radiations of diﬀerent energies are discussed. Other publications also deal
with this subject (e.g., SSK, 2005, Harder et al., 2004).
(B 88) In-vitro investigations of dicentric chromosome aberrations in human lym-
phocytes (Sasaki, 1991, Schmid et al., 2002, Guerrero-Carbajal et al., 2003), and formutations and transformations in other cell lines, e.g., in human and human–ham-ster hybrid cells by Frankenberg et al. (2002), have shown that low energy x rayshave a signiﬁcantly larger RBE than
60Co-gamma rays. In such experiments with
cells, 20 kV x rays may be about 2 to 3 times as eﬀective as conventional 200 kV
x rays and these are about twice as eﬀective as60Co gamma rays. In animal exper-
iments, much lower ratios have been observed while epidemiological data are notsuﬃciently precise to see any diﬀerences.
(B 89) While photons of 1 to 5 MeV are less eﬀective than x rays, as demonstrated
by cellular eﬀects in vitro, the situation may be diﬀerent for very high energy pho-tons, e.g., near high energy accelerators, or in radiation ﬁelds of cosmic rays. Suchphotons are able to produce secondary particles in nuclear interactions, e.g., neu-trons or other high-LET particles. It can, therefore, not be excluded that the RBE
value for these photons is higher than that of photons of about 1 to 5 MeV.
(B 90) The Commission stated in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) that ‘simplicity is
important to reﬂect our lack of precise information in man and an appreciation ofthe practical aspects of radiological protection. For example, the Commission doesnot believe it is helpful to adopt diﬀerent quality-factor values for diﬀerent photonenergies.’ More data is now available from investigations on cells showing signiﬁcantdiﬀerences in radiation quality of photons of diﬀerent energies. However, there areadditional practical arguments for keeping a single w
Rvalue for all photons and elec-
trons for the calculation of eﬀective dose (Dietze and Alberts, 2004).
(B 91) In the case of external exposure to photons with energies from 30 keV to 5
MeV a proportion of the dose delivered to the organs is due to Compton-scatteredphotons in the body with an average energy signiﬁcantly lower than that of the inci-dent photons (Harder et al., 2004). Therefore, the variation of the mean RBE aver-aged over the human body for external photon radiations with diﬀerent energies isexpected to be smaller than the corresponding diﬀerences observed in investiga-tions with thin cell layers in vitro (frequently mono-layers). Chen et al. (2005) have
278ICRP Publication 103calculated the microdosimetric quantity, dose mean lineal energy, yD, in small and
large receptors, and have shown that the above-mentioned eﬀect is not as large asassumed by Harder et al. (2004).
(B 92) Furthermore, external low-energy photon radiation (less than about 30 kV
x rays) is strongly attenuated in tissue close to the surface of the body and its con-
tribution to eﬀective dose is generally small. An exception to this statement is the use
of low-energy photons in radiodiagnostic procedures such as mammography. In thiscase of external exposure, however, the operational dose quantities H
*(10) and
Hp(10) (see Sections B.4.3 and B.4.4) are used for radiation protection monitoring
and for assessing eﬀective dose. For photons with energies between 10 keV and 40keV and frontal irradiation (AP) of the body, H
*(10), is up to a factor 6 higher than
Eand, for other directions of radiation incidence (PA, LAT, ROT, ISO), this con-
servatism is even greater (ICRP, 1996b).
(B 93) In internal dosimetry, a single wRvalue for all photons and electrons is a
major simpliﬁcation, but the arguments in support of this approach are the sameas for external exposures. The special case of the probable greater eﬀectiveness ofshort-range emissions from tritium and Auger emitters when the radionuclides areincorporated into DNA or otherwise localised in cell nuclei is discussed in SectionB.3.3.
(B 94) However, the use of w
R¼1 for low-energy beta emissions from tritium is
still the subject of scientiﬁc debate (CERRIE, 2004). Straume and Carsten (1993)
provided a thorough review of experimental data on the carcinogenic, genetic, devel-
opmental and reproductive eﬀects of exposure to tritiated water (HTO) and organ-ically bound forms of tritium (OBT) in animals and in in-vitro cell systems. Thespectrum of observed eﬀects is indistinguishable from the eﬀects of whole body exter-nal irradiation with x rays or gamma rays. Although the observed eﬀects of tritiumare very largely attributable to damage from ionising radiation, the transmutation oftritium to helium also has the potential to cause damage to DNA. The observedeﬀects of tritium will include any contribution from such transmutation damage.
Considering all observed eﬀects of HTO exposure, RBE values were in the range
1–3.5. For comparisons with gamma rays, most values were between 1 and 3 whilefor x rays most were from 1 to 2, with values of 1–1.5 predominating. These mea-sured RBEs for tritium beta irradiation are reasonably consistent with estimatesbased on microdosimetric considerations (Bigildeev et al., 1992, Morstin et al.,1993, Moiseenko et al., 1997).
(B 95) For the purposes of assessing risk at low chronic doses, studies of carcino-
genesis are the most appropriate. These include studies of the acceleration of the
appearance of mammary tumours in rats (Gragtmans et al., 1984) and the induction
of acute myeloid leukaemia in mice (Johnson et al., 1995). Both these studies com-pared chronic exposure to HTO or to x rays (250 kVp) and gave RBE values of1–1.3. In-vitro studies of transformation in 10T1/2 cells gave RBE values of up toabout 2 compared to gamma rays.
(B 96) The RBE values obtained for beta emissions from tritium as HTO are
within the range of values observed generally for low-LET radiations and thereforethe simpliﬁed approach of using a single w
Rvalue of 1 is applicable to tritium. The
279ICRP Publication 103limited RBE data for OBT (organically bound tritium) show similar values to those
for HTO in most cases (e.g., labelled amino acids) but higher values for tritiatedDNA precursors. For example, Ueno et al. (1989) compared RBE values forHTO,
3H-thymidine (3HTdR) and3H-amino acids, measuring cell killing and muta-
tion rates in mouse cells cultured in vitro. Doses were estimated on the basis of mea-
surements of the3H content of cells and on the assumption that3HTdR was
concentrated in the nucleus and that HTO and3H-amino acids had a uniform cellu-
lar distribution. On this basis for3HTdR a greater eﬀect by a factor of 2 was ob-
tained than for HTO and for3H-amino acids.
(B 97) The biological eﬀects of Auger emitters have been extensively studied in a
variety of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental systems (Bingham et al., 2000, Godduet al., 1996). In vivo, rodent spermatogenesis has been utilised as a model systemto evaluate the cytotoxicity of a range of Auger emitters including
55Fe,99mTc,
111In,114mIn,123I,125I, and210Tl. In vitro, the cytotoxic eﬀects of35S,75Se,51Cr,
67Ga,77Br, and a range of compounds labelled with123I and125I, have been studied
in a variety of human and rodent cell lines and model culture systems. Representa-tive of various results reported are an increase of biological eﬀectiveness by a factorof 7–9 for
125I when the radionuclide is incorporated into DNA following adminis-
tration as125I-iododeoyuridine (125IUdR), RBE values of around 4 for125I localised
in the nucleus, but not directly bound to DNA, and RBE values of around 1 when
125I is localised in the cytoplasm (Hofer et al., 1975; Howell et al., 1993; Kassis et al.,
1989; Rao et al., 1990; Warters et al., 1978).
(B 98) Various dosimetric schemes have been proposed for Auger emitters, includ-
ing the use of a wRof 20 for the proportion of emitters bound to DNA where this is
known (Howell et al., 1993). It is clear that assessment of doses and risks will requireinformation on the distribution of radionuclides within tissues and cells, which willdepend on the chemical form involved. It is only when the Auger emitter is concen-trated in the nucleus that a signiﬁcantly enhanced eﬀect would be anticipated, com-pared with that evaluated on the basis of average tissue dose. The Commission
recognises these uncertainties and has stated that Auger emitters will need analysis
on a case-by-case basis.
(B 99) In summary, there are good arguments for the continued use of a w
Rof 1 for
all low-LET radiations for general radiological protection purposes. It is, however,important to note that this simpliﬁcation is suﬃcient only for the intended applicationof assessing eﬀective dose, e.g., for dose limitation, assessment and controlling ofdoses. It is not intended for retrospective assessment of individual risks of stochasticeﬀects from radiation exposures. In such cases of individual retrospective dose assess-
ment more detailed information on the radiation ﬁeld (including the type of low-LET
radiation) and appropriate RBE values may need to be considered if they are avail-able (see Section B.5.8). Heterogeneity of dose within cells, as can occur with tritiumor Auger emitters incorporated into DNA, may also require speciﬁc analysis.
(B 100) Radiation weighting factors for neutrons. The biological eﬀectiveness of
neutrons incident on the human body is strongly dependent on the neutron energybecause of the variation of the secondary radiation with energy. Qualitatively, thefollowing eﬀects are important:
280ICRP Publication 103/C15the production of secondary photons by neutron absorption in tissue which
increases with decreasing neutron energy;
/C15the increase of the energy of recoil protons with increasing neutron energy;
/C15the release of heavier charged particles at higher neutron energies; and
/C15nuclear spallation processes at very high neutron energies.
(B 101) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) the radiation weighting factor for neu-
trons has been given in two ways, by a step function deﬁning ﬁve neutron energyranges with w
Rvalues of 5, 10, 20, 10, and 5 respectively (Table B.3, Fig. B.4),
and by a continuous function for use in calculations. The tabulated values of wRhave
generally not been used in practice; the continuous function has usually been ap-
plied. In radiation ﬁelds containing neutrons with a broad energy spectrum very of-ten calculations using energy-dependent conversion coeﬃcients are performed forestimating doses. All internationally recommended conversion coeﬃcients, includingthose given in Publication 74 (ICRP, 1996b) are based on the continuous function.
Therefore, a continuous function is given here for deﬁning radiation weighting fac-tors for neutrons. It should be noted, however, that the use of a continuous functionis based only on practical and computational considerations and does not imply the
availability of more precise data.
(B 102) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) a maximum value of 20 was ﬁxed for w
R.
InPublication 92 (ICRP, 2003c) it is stated that, in the neutron energy region near 1
MeV, the maximum value of wRof about 20 is still an acceptable approximation.
This judgement is not based on a speciﬁc experimental value but rather reﬂects a rep-resentative value considering the broad range of RBE values from experimental ani-mal data for carcinogenesis and life shortening obtained from investigations using
Fig. B.4. Radiation weighting factor, wR, for neutrons versus neutron energy. Step function and
continuous function given in Publication 60 (ICRP 1991b) and function adopted in the 2007
Recommendations.
281ICRP Publication 103ﬁssion neutrons from reactors (ICRP, 2003c). This value of 20 is, therefore, retained
for neutron energies at about 1 MeV.
(B 103) When the human body is exposed to neutrons with energies below 1 MeV, a
signiﬁcant fraction of the absorbed dose is deposited by secondary photons mainlyfrom the H(n, c) reaction, which reduces the biological eﬀectiveness. In this energy
range this eﬀect on RBE is much larger than the inﬂuence of the change in the LET-
distribution of the neutron-produced secondary charged particles, mainly protons.
(B 104) When RBE data for ﬁssion neutrons or low-energy neutrons obtained
from investigations with small animals are used as the basis for the evaluation ofw
Rvalues for human exposure, it should be recognised that the dose contribution
from secondary photons in the human body is higher than in small animals suchas mice (Dietze and Siebert, 1994). The photons are mainly produced by the captureof degraded neutrons, predominantly in hydrogen, and their contribution to the total
equivalent dose in an organ is strongly dependent on the body size and on the posi-
tion of the organ in the body. At the time of Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) data from
calculations with neutrons in anthropomorphic phantoms were not available, anddata calculated for the ICRU sphere were used instead. It has been shown (ICRP,2003c, SSK, 2005) that for neutrons below about 1 MeV, the consideration of thesecondary photons in an anthropomorphic phantom results in considerably lowervalues for mean quality factors, and thus of w
R, than those given in Publication 60 .
(B 105) In Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c), it is suggested that the dependence of the
radiation weighting factor on neutron energy should be based on the Q(L) function
deﬁned in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) and the calculation of a human body aver-
aged mean quality factor qE(see Eqn. B.3.10). The relationship between qEand the
weighting factor w Ris given there by a function
wR¼1:6ðqE/C01Þþ1 ðB:3:10Þ
This equation preserves a value of wRof about 20 at neutron energies near 1 MeV.
Calculations of qEhave been performed taking the dose distribution in the human
body into account and using the tissue weighting factors wTof the diﬀerent organs
and tissues by the equation
qE¼X
TwTQTDT=X
TwTDT ðB:3:11Þ
where QTis the mean quality factor in the tissue or organ T, and DTthe correspond-
ing mean absorbed dose. Owing to the diﬀerent wTvalues of the organs and tissues
not being symmetrically distributed in the human body, the value of qEdepends on
the directional incidence of the radiation on the body. The calculations have shownthat, for thermal neutrons, the deduced w
R(Eqn. B.3.10) may vary from 2.5 (for ISO
and ROT incidence) to 3.2 (for AP incidence) for the various exposure conditions,and that there are also diﬀerences depending on the sex of the selected model(Kellerer et al., 2004). In general, the value of q
Edepends also on the model of
the human body, e.g., if the calculations are performed with a MIRD-type phantom
or a voxel type phantom (see Section B.5.2).
282ICRP Publication 103(B 106) In principle, the proposal of deﬁning a general relationship between wR
and a mean quality factor qEfor all types and energies of particles as given in
Eqn. (B.3.10) is attractive, because it points more clearly to the common scientiﬁcbasis of the concept of radiation weighting and quality factor used in the deﬁnitionof the operational quantities. In practice, however, Eqn. (B.3.10) can only be applied
to strongly penetrating external high-LET radiation, e.g., neutrons, high-energy pro-
tons and heavy ions with very high energies. A factor of 1.6 has been introduced inEqn. (B.3.10) in order to ﬁt the calculated w
R-value for 1 MeV neutrons to experi-
mental data. It is questionable whether it is justiﬁed to extend this factor to otherparticles and energies with diﬀerent secondary charged particle spectra. Anothershortcoming of deﬁning this general relationship is the fact that q
Edepends on many
parameters, such as the phantom selected, the wTvalues, the exposure situation cho-
sen and even the computer code used. Many parameters may give rise to changes in
future while wRshould remain stable. Equation (B.3.10) is therefore to be used only
as a guide in establishing values of wRfor neutrons.
(B 107) For neutron energies of less than 1 MeV a similar energy dependence of
the radiation weighting has been obtained also by other considerations (SSK,2005, Dietze and Harder, 2004) without using a ﬁxed relationship between Qand
w
R. The relationship is based on the assumption that, with neutron energies below
1 MeV, the energy dependence of the neutron weighting for the human body de-pends mainly on the dose contribution of secondary photons and that, for a small
tissue probe, the mean RBE value for the neutron-induced high-LET component
(RBE
high-LET , mainly determined by recoil protons, protons from N(n,p) and heavier
ions) is approximately independent of neutron energy (Edwards, 1997, Sasaki, 1991,Schmid et al., 2003).
(B 108) For anterior-posterior radiation incidence the mean absorbed dose contri-
bution from secondary photons f
low-LET (low-LET component relative to the total
dose) in the human body and the contribution from secondary charged particles(high-LET component) have been calculated by
f
low-LET ¼ðRwTDTflow-LET ;TÞ=ðRwTDTÞand ðB:3:12Þ
fhigh-LET ¼1/C0flow-LET ðB:3:13Þ
where flow-LET ;Tis the relative absorbed dose contribution in the tissue or organ T
from secondary low-LET radiation. For the calculation of a body-averaged relativebiological eﬀectiveness the following equation has been applied:
RBE
av¼RBE high-LET ð1/C0flow-LET ÞþRBE low-LET flow-LET ðB:3:14Þ
where RBE avis the resulting RBE properly averaged over the human body. This
‘mixing rule’ is applied in the neutron energy range from thermal up to 1 MeV.For the photon contribution a value of RBE
low-LET = 1 is taken, and for the high-
LET component a mean value of RBE high-LET = 25 is chosen which is consistent with
experimental data on the induction of dicentric chromosomal aberrations in cells(Schmid et al., 2003) and animal data for tumour induction and life shortening(SSK, 2005). These selected RBE-values result in an RBE
avvalue of about 20 in
283ICRP Publication 103the human body for neutrons of 1 MeV which is consistent with the value mentioned
above. Depending on the exposure conditions chosen, the energy dependence ofRBE
avis similar to that of wRcalculated by Eqn. (B.3.10) in the energy range from
thermal up to 1 MeV neutrons.
(B 109) In view of all these considerations the following function is given for the
deﬁnition of the radiation weighting factor in the energy range below 1 MeV:
wR¼2:5þ18:2 exp ½/C0ðlnEnÞ2=6/C138forEn<1 MeV ðEnin MeV Þð B:3:15Þ
(B 110) Figure B.4 shows that, in the neutron energy range below 1 MeV, the val-
ues of wRare lower than those given in Publication 60 (1991b). The function fully
reﬂects the eﬀect of secondary photons in the body and is well related to the meanquality factor q
Eas given in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c).
(B 111) The energy range above 1 MeV needs diﬀerent considerations. In this en-
ergy range, almost no new experimental data is available from investigations of ani-mals. All existing experimental data either on animals or on cells, however, show aclear decrease of RBE with increasing neutron energy. This is consistent with calcu-lations based on the Q(L) function (ICRP, 2003c). If, however, the relationship be-
tween q
EandwRas deﬁned in Eqn. (B.3.10) were applied, this would result in an
increase of wRfor neutrons of about 30% in the energy range between 5 MeV and
100 MeV relative to the data of the continuous function as deﬁned in Publication
60(ICRP, 1991b). This diﬀerence is much less than the uncertainty of RBE values
in this energy range. Therefore, from a practical point of view, it seems more appro-priate not to apply minor changes to the existing function in this energy range, but tostay with the values deﬁned in Publication 60 .
(B 112) There is no published experimental data with animals for neutron energies
above about 50 MeV. Some RBE data on the induction of dicentric chromosomes in
human lymphocytes was published recently (Nolte et al., 2005). These data togetherwith the calculations of Pelliccioni (1998, 2004), Yoshizawa et al. (1998), and Satoet al. (2003) have shown that the mean quality factor averaged over the human bodydecreases with increasing neutron energy to values of less than 5, and reaches valuesnear to those of protons at very high energies above 1 GeV. While this topic mayneed more detailed considerations in the future, a continuous weighting factor func-tion for neutrons is also used for energies above 50 MeV. Its value decreases with
increasing energy from about 5.5 at 50 MeV to about 2.5 at 10 GeV. This function
is ﬁtted to the function for lower neutron energies at 50 MeV. The neutron energydependence of the data published by Pelliccioni (1998, 2004), Yoshizawa et al.(1998), and Sato et al. (2003) has been used as a guideline for the higher energies.
(B 113) In summary, the following continuous functions are used for the calcula-
tion of radiation weighting factors for neutrons:

284ICRP Publication 103Obviously these functions are complex. They have been chosen as an empirical ap-
proach describing the weighting of neutrons over more than 10 decades of neutronenergy. The detailed functions, however, should not be misinterpreted to reﬂect pre-cisely the biological data which, in fact, show a broad range of RBE values depend-ing on neutron dose, neutron dose rate and biological endpoint considered.
(B 114) The preceding extensive discussion of this important matter of energy
dependence of w
Rfor neutrons can be summarised as follows:
/C15The new Recommendations adopt a w Rfunction for neutrons which is based
upon that given in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c) but takes into account additional
data.
The function for wRfor neutrons is derived using the following criteria:
/C15A continuous wRfunction is chosen instead of a step function (ICRP, 1991b) for
practical reasons. This decision, however, is not the result of a higher precision ofthe available radiobiological data but is based on practical considerations.
/C15For neutrons of about 1 MeV a maximum w
Rvalue of about 20 is retained as
given in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) and in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c).
/C15For neutron energies below about 1 MeV the shape of the curve for the energy
dependence of w Ris generally based on that related to the mean quality factor
qE, as well as on the mean RBE avexpressed in Eqn. (B.3.14). The recommended
wRvalues are similar to those proposed in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c).
/C15At energies above 50 MeV, for physical reasons w Rshould asymptotically
approach a value close to that of protons (for which some radiobiological dataexist). Based on calculations by Pelliccioni (1998, 2004), Yoshizawa et al. (1998)and Sato et al. (2003) an asymptotic value of 2.5 at neutron energies above
1 GeV is chosen.
(B 115) The resulting function (Fig. B.4) is consistent with existing relevant phys-
ical and biological knowledge. The function does not establish a strict relationship
between the mean quality factor and the radiation weighting factor for all neutron
energies as proposed in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c), and therefore there is not a
fully common approach for protection and operational quantities, for the reasonsgiven above. For radiological protection it appears, however, to be more importantthat the operational dose quantities for use in external exposure monitoring providea good and conservative estimate of eﬀective dose under most exposure conditions.This is achieved when applying the radiation weighting factors for neutrons as givenin Eqn. (B.3.16).
(B 116) Radiation weighting factor for protons and pions. Only external radiation
sources have to be considered for exposure to protons in practical radiological pro-tection. In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) a radiation weighting factor of 5 was recom-
mended for all protons with energies above 2 MeV except recoil protons (Table B.3).
(B 117) In recent years, proton radiation has received more attention owing to an
increased interest in dose assessment for exposure to aircrew and to astronauts inspace vehicles. In these cases the external proton radiation exposure is from solarand cosmic radiation. In the primary radiation ﬁelds, high energy protons strongly
285ICRP Publication 103dominate, and protons with energy of a few MeV are of minor signiﬁcance, even
when considering the increasing biological eﬀectiveness at low energies. The rangeof low-energy protons in tissue is small (range of protons in tissue: 4 MeV protons:0.25 mm; 10 MeV protons: 1.2 mm) and they will mostly be absorbed in the skin.
(B 118) It is, therefore, judged to be suﬃciently accurate for applications in radio-
logical protection to adopt a single w
Rvalue for protons of all energies. It is appro-
priate to rely on data for high energy protons as these are the most relevant in cosmicradiation ﬁelds.
(B 119) There are very few investigations using animals that give information on
the RBE for high energy protons. Most measured RBE values are between 1 and 2.With respect to the ionisation density in tissue, high energy protons can be regardedas low-LET radiation (with a mean LET value much less than 10 keV/ lm) and,
applying the Q(L) function from Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), the mean quality fac-
tor of 100 MeV protons stopping in tissue is calculated to be less than 1.2 (ICRP,
2003c). At very high proton energies near 1 GeV, secondary charged particles fromnuclear reactions become more important, and the mean quality factor increases upto about 1.8.
(B 120) Taking all considerations and available data into account, the radiation
weighting factor adopted for protons in the new Recommendations is 2 (Table B.4).
(B 121) Pions are negatively or positively charged or neutral particles encountered
in radiation ﬁelds at altitude in the atmosphere, resulting from interactions of the
primary cosmic rays (predominantly high-energy protons) with nuclei in the atmo-
sphere, thus contributing to the exposure of aircraft crew and passengers (approxi-mately 0.1% of H
*(10)). They are also found as part of the complex radiation
ﬁelds behind shielding of high-energy particle accelerators and thus may contributeto the occupational exposure of accelerator staﬀ (up to 4% of H
*(10)). The mass of
pions is equivalent to 273 electron masses and approximately 1/7 of a proton mass.Charged pions lose their energy mainly through Coulomb interactions. When nega-tive pions come to rest they are usually captured by nuclei which then disintegrate
emitting a variety of high-LET particles (‘star fragmentation’).
(B 122) Pelliccioni (1998) has carried out Monte Carlo calculations for evaluating
mean quality factors averaged over the human body (see Eqn. B.3.12) for pions as afunction of their energy. The results show that there is a moderate energy depen-dence of the mean quality factor for positive pions and for negative pions above50 MeV (values between 1 and 2). Below this energy, the star fragmentation leadsto an increase of q
Eof negative pions.
(B 123) Considering that the energy distribution of pionsa in real radiation ﬁeld is
very broad and in view of their small contribution to total exposure in complex high-
energy ﬁelds, it is recommended to use a weighting factor of 2 for all charged pions.
(B 124) Radiation weighting factor for alpha particles. Exposure of humans to
alpha particles is predominantly from internal emitters, e.g., from inhaled radonprogeny or ingested alpha-emitting radionuclides such as isotopes of plutonium,polonium, radium, thorium, and uranium. There are a number of epidemiologicalstudies that provide information on the risk from inhaled or intravenously injectedalpha emitters. The distribution of radionuclides and the estimation of dose and its
286ICRP Publication 103distribution in tissues and organs are very complex and dependent on the models
used. The dose distribution is generally very heterogeneous and the calculated dosesare, therefore, associated with substantial uncertainties. For this reason epidemiolog-ical as well as experimental studies, although they can provide valuable guidance,cannot be used as the only basis for an assessment of the RBE for alpha emitters.
From calculations using stopping power data for alpha particles in tissue and the
Q(L) function, the mean quality factor of 6 MeV alpha particles slowing down in tis-
sues is estimated to be about 20.
(B 125) Reviews of available human and animal data on RBE for alpha-emitting
radionuclides indicate that RBE depends on the biological end-point under consid-eration (UNSCEAR, 2000, Harrison and Muirhead, 2003). Variations betweenradionuclides in RBE values for the same end-point can be attributed mainly to dif-ferences in location of the emitter in tissue. The limited human data that allow esti-
mation of alpha particle RBE values suggest values of around 10–20 for lung and
liver cancer and lower values for bone cancer and leukaemia.
(B 126) There is good evidence, from animal and in-vitro studies, of RBE values
for alpha emitters of around 10 or greater, compared with external low-LET radia-tions, for cancer-related eﬀects. Studies of bone cancer induction in dogs suggest dif-ferent RBE values for this endpoint for diﬀerent bone-seeking alpha-emittingradionuclides, with high values for
239Pu and low values for Ra isotopes (UNSCE-
AR, 2000). However, these comparisons are based on average skeletal doses, and the
diﬀerences are most likely to be attributable to the diﬀerent locations of the radio-
nuclides in bone, with greater doses to target cells near to bone surfaces from
239Pu and related actinide isotopes, which concentrate at bone surfaces, compared
to isotopes of Ra which (as alkaline earth elements chemically similar to Ca) tendto be distributed more uniformly through the calciﬁed bone matrix (ICRP, 1993c,Harrison and Muirhead, 2003). Human and animal data suggest that the RBE forthe risk of leukaemia from alpha emitters deposited in bone is less than 20 (WHO,2001, Harrison and Muirhead, 2003). The use of a w
Rof 20 for alpha particles
may thus lead to an overestimation of risk to target cells within active (red) bone
marrow.
(B 127) Judgements on the available data and the selection of a wRvalue for alpha
particles have been reviewed in Publication 92 (ICRP, 2003c). As recent data do not
strongly support the need for a change of the radiation weighting factor for alphaparticles, the w
Rvalue of 20 is retained for these Recommendations (see Table B.4).
(B 128) Radiation weighting factor for heavy ions and ﬁssion fragments. Doses from
ﬁssion fragments are of importance for radiological protection mainly in internal
dosimetry, and the situation regarding radiation weighting factors may be seen as
similar to that for alpha particles. Owing to their short ranges, the biokinetics anddistribution of the actinides in the organs and tissues are very important and havea strong inﬂuence on their biological eﬀectiveness. A radiation weighting factor of20, as given in Tables B.3 and B.4, equal to that for alpha particles, may be regardedas a rough conservative estimate. The short range of the ﬁssion fragments in tissueand the high energy transferred, therefore, to a small volume of tissue results in avery high local dose at this point, which may reduce their RBE. As has been
287ICRP Publication 103discussed in Section B.3.2, care must be taken when applying the concept of mean
organ or tissue doses in such cases, and speciﬁc considerations are necessary.
(B 129) In external exposure heavy ions are mainly encountered in radiation ﬁelds
near high energy accelerators, at aviation heights, and in space. Few RBE data forheavy ions are available and most are from in-vitro experiments. Publication 92
(ICRP, 2003c) provides an overview on radiobiological data from which RBE values
have been derived of relevance for deﬁning radiation weighting factor values.
(B 130) RBE
Mvalues of about 30 have been reported for induction of Harderian
gland tumours in mice by the heavy ions40Ar and56Fe and lower values with radi-
ation beams of lower LET (Fry et al., 1985, Alpen et al., 1993). The results indicatethat RBE values reach a peak at about 100–200 keV lm
/C01and remain at this level at
higher LETs. RBE values for ﬁssion neutrons in the same system were shown to cor-respond to the maximum observed RBE value for heavy ions. In vitro studies of
chromosome aberrations, cell transformation, and mutations also provide evi-
dence of increasing RBE of heavy ions with increasing LET up to around100–200 keV lm
/C01, but suggest a decrease at very high LETs.
(B 131) Mean quality factors have been calculated by Sato et al. (2004). The radi-
ation quality of the particle changes strongly along the track for heavy ions incidenton a human body and stopped in the body. An averaged value may be chosen to de-rive a w
R. The selection of a single wRvalue of 20 for all types and energies of heavy
ions is judged to be appropriate for general application in radiological protection.
For applications in space, where these particles contribute signiﬁcantly to the total
dose in the human body, a more realistic approach may be chosen based on the cal-culation of a mean quality factor in the human body as mentioned in Section B.3.5,paragraphs B 100 – B 115.
Tissue weighting factors
(B 132) The deﬁnition of eﬀective dose takes into account the diﬀerent relative
radiosensitivities of the various organs and tissues in the human body with respectto radiation detriment from stochastic eﬀects. For this purpose, weighting factors,
w
T, were introduced in Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977) for six identiﬁed tissues and
for a remaining group of tissues (collectively referred to as the ‘remainder’). In Pub-
lication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) tissue weighting factors were speciﬁed for twelve tissues
and organs and the ‘remainder’ (Table B.1). The tissue weighting factors are relativevalues, and their sum is equal to one so that a uniform dose distribution in the wholebody gives an eﬀective dose numerically equal to the equivalent dose in each organand tissue of the body.
(B 133) The tissue weighting factors determined for these 2007 Recommendations
are based on detriment-adjusted nominal risk coeﬃcients for stochastic eﬀects (An-
nex A). The unadjusted nominal risk coeﬃcients are calculated by averaging esti-mates of the radiation-associated lifetime risk for cancer incidence for a compositepopulation of equal numbers of males and females. The detriment is modelled asa function of life lost, lethality and loss of quality of life. With a few exceptions,the parameters in the risk models are estimated using cancer incidence data from
288ICRP Publication 103the studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Both excess relative risk and ex-
cess absolute risk models are developed for most cancer sites.
(B 134) For heritable disease, the risk in the ﬁrst two generations is taken into ac-
count as discussed and described in Annex A. The relative radiation detriments diﬀerfrom those given in Publication 60 , and this has resulted in changes to the w
Tvalues.
The main changes are for breast (from 0.05 to 0.12), gonads (from 0.20 to 0.08) and
remainder tissues (from 0.05 to 0.12). In addition, speciﬁc wTvalues of 0.01 are now
given for the brain and salivary glands. The tissue weighting factors proposed by theCommission for the present Recommendations are given in Table B.2.
(B 135) The tissue weighting factors, w
T, are sex-averaged and are for the assess-
ment of eﬀective dose for workers as well as members of the public, including chil-dren. Recently the w
Tvalues were also applied to the developing fetus in Publication
88(ICRP, 2001), although it was recognised that ‘these wTvalues have been devel-
oped for exposure of individuals after birth and that the apportionment of radiation
detriment that these values imply may not be appropriate for doses received in ute-ro’. The approach was, however, adopted in the absence of comprehensive data onthe relative risks to organs and tissues from exposures in utero. It was concluded inPublication 90 (ICRP, 2003a) and by Streﬀer (2005) that there are at present insuf-
ﬁcient data to be able to make recommendations of speciﬁc w
Tvalues for prenatal
radiation exposures.
(B 136) In the case of sex-speciﬁc diﬀerences in relative detriment based on cancer
incidence for the ovaries of females (Annex A, Section A.4.6) the sex-averaged wTof
0.08 assigned to the gonads (cancer plus heritable eﬀects) is similar to that of thefemale ovaries (0.036) plus heritable eﬀects (0.039). In this way the ovary of femalesis judged to be suﬃciently protected.
(B 137) In the case of the thyroid, the values of the relative detriment based on
cancer incidence for females (0.021) and males (0.008) (Annex A, Section A.4.6)diﬀer by a factor of almost 3. However, since the w
Tassigned to the thyroid is given
as 0.04 to allow for the high susceptibility of young children, the diﬀerence in detri-
ment between the sexes is considered in a conservative manner.
(B 138) A particular issue in the calculation of eﬀective dose is the assessment of
the dose to ‘remainder’ tissues. In Publication 26 (ICRP, 1977), the remainder tissue
was assigned a weighting factor of 0.30. The dose equivalent to the remainder tissueswas taken to be the arithmetic average of the dose to the ﬁve most highly irradiatedtissues of the remainder by allocating a w
Tvalue of 0.06 to each of these tissues. This
procedure resulted in a lack of additivity of the eﬀective dose equivalent quantity,since the ﬁve tissues could vary for diﬀerent exposures, either external or internal.
(B 139) In Publication 60 , the remainder tissue was given a weighting factor of
0.05. However, additivity was still lacking although reduced in magnitude owingto the splitting rule given in Note 3 of Table A-3 in Publication 60 (see below).
The equivalent dose for the remainder was given as the mean value for ten speciﬁedtissues and organs (Table B.1). The upper large intestine, formerly included in theremainder (ICRP, 1991b), was taken together with the lower large intestine, to deﬁnethe colon (ICRP, 1995a). Publication 66 (ICRP, 1994a) dealing with doses to the
289ICRP Publication 103respiratory tract and dose coeﬃcients for inhaled radionuclides speciﬁed that the
extrathoracic airways be considered as part of the remainder.
(B 140) While not detailed in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b), the treatment of
remainder was described in Publications 68 and 72(ICRP, 1994b, 1996c). The
remainder dose was deﬁned by the mass-weighted average of the equivalent dose
to organs and tissues of the remainder (Note 2 of Table A-3 in Publication 60 ). Ow-
ing to the very diﬀerent masses the contribution of the speciﬁed tissues and organs tothe remainder dose was very diﬀerent. Because of its large mass, muscle received aneﬀective weighting factor of nearly 0.05 which is not justiﬁed because its radiationsensitivity is judged to be low. For external exposure, however, the dose to the var-ious tissues are similar (diﬀer little from that of muscle) and hence in Publication 74
(ICRP, 1996b) a simple arithmetic dose averaging with no further weighting wasused as an approximation (see Section B.3.4).
(B 141) The method for calculating eﬀective dose recommended in Publication 60
(ICRP, 1991b) includes provision for cases when a remainder tissue which does nothave an explicit weighting factor ðw
TÞreceives the highest dose of all tissues. In these
cases the wTfor remainder (0.05) is divided equally between the mass-weighted aver-
age dose to remainder tissues (i.e., the default remainder dose, see above) and theparticular tissue. This is often referred to as the ‘splitting rule’ and cases where therule applies are known as ‘split remainder’ cases.
(B 142) Implications of this rule were explored by Nelson et al. (1997). The inten-
tion of the splitting rule was to provide protection, through the eﬀective dose and its
related limits, to potentially highly exposed tissues (such as extrathoracic region, ET
1
or the kidney after incorporation of certain radionuclides) which had not been as-signed a speciﬁc weighting factor. One of the drawbacks of this approach, however,is that, since the formulation of the eﬀective dose can diﬀer for diﬀerent radionuc-lides or for diﬀerent external photon beam energies, it is not strictly an additivequantity.
(B 143) It is now recommended that the equivalent doses to the speciﬁed tissues of
the remainder given in Table B.2 are added with no further mass weighting. This
means that the weighting factor given to each of the remainder tissues is smaller thanthe least value assigned to any of the named tissues (0.01). For remainder tissues thew
Tis 0.12.
(B 144) In its computations, the Commission assigns a dose to the remainder
which represents the arithmetic average of the doses to the remainder tissues of bothsexes. Analogous to the approach for other organs and tissues, the equivalent dose tothe remainder is deﬁned separately for males and females, and these values are in-
cluded into Eqn. (B.3.9). The equivalent dose to the remainder tissues is computed
as the arithmetic mean of the equivalent doses to the tissues listed in the footnotesto Table B.2. The current remainder formulation speciﬁes 12 tissues common to bothsexes and one sex-speciﬁc tissue in each sex (prostate in the male and uterus/cervix inthe female) for a total of 13 tissues. The equivalent dose to the tissues of remainder ofthe male, H
M

rem, are computed as:

T: ðB:3:17Þ
(B 145) The summation in Eqn. (B.3.9) extends over the equivalent dose to remain-
der tissues in the male and female.

293ICRP Publication 103.B.4. Operational quantities
(B 146) The body-related protection quantities (equivalent dose and eﬀective dose)
are not measurable in practice and therefore cannot be used directly as quantities inradiation monitoring. Operational quantities are, therefore, used for the assessment
of eﬀective dose or equivalent doses in tissues or organs (Figs B.1 and B.2).
(B 147) Operational quantities are aimed at providing an estimate or upper limit
for the value of the protection quantities related to an exposure, or potential expo-sure of persons under most irradiation conditions. They are often used in practicalregulations or guidance. As shown in Fig. B.2, diﬀerent types of operational quan-tities are used for internal and external exposures. For monitoring of external radi-ation exposures operational dose quantities have been deﬁned by ICRU (ICRU,1985, 1988), see Section B.4.2, and, during the 1990s, introduced into radiological
protection practice in many countries. Their further use is recommended, and only
small changes are proposed. In internal dosimetry, no operational dose quantitieshave been deﬁned which directly provide an assessment of equivalent or eﬀectivedose. Diﬀerent methods are applied to assess the equivalent or eﬀective dose dueto radionuclides in the human body. They are mostly based on various activity mea-surements and the application of biokinetic models (computational models) (see Sec-tion B.4.2).
B.4.1. External exposure
(B 148) Speciﬁc operational dose equivalent quantities are deﬁned for radiation
monitoring in situations of external exposure (area or individual monitoring). Inroutine monitoring, the values of these dose-equivalent quantities are taken as suﬃ-ciently precise assessments of eﬀective dose or skin dose, respectively, especially iftheir values are below the protection limits.
(B 149) Operational dose quantities are used for monitoring external exposures
because:
/C15point quantities are needed for area monitoring;
/C15in area monitoring, the value of the dose quantity should not depend on the direc-
tional distribution of the incident radiation;
/C15instruments for radiation monitoring need to be calibrated in terms of a physical
quantity for which calibration standards exist.
(B 150) Diﬀerent operational dose equivalent quantities have been deﬁned for area
and individual monitoring.
(B 151) The basic concept of the operational dose quantities for external exposure
is described in ICRU Reports 39 and 43 (ICRU, 1985, 1988). The deﬁnitionsadopted for the 2007 Recommendations are given in ICRU Report 51 (ICRU,1993b) and in ICRU Report 66 (ICRU, 2001b).
(B 152) As described in Section B.1, the quantity dose equivalent, H, is deﬁned by
H¼Q/C1D ðB:4:1Þ
295ICRP Publication 103where Dis the absorbed dose at the point of interest in tissue and Qthe correspond-
ing quality factor at this point, the value of which is determined by the type andenergy of charged particles passing a small volume element at this point. It is wellknown that the biological eﬀectiveness of a radiation is correlated with the ionisationdensity along the track of charged particles in tissue. Therefore, Qis deﬁned as a
function of the unrestricted linear energy transfer, L
1(often denoted as L or
LET), of charged particles in water:
QðLÞ¼1 L<10 keV =lm
0:32L/C02:21 06L6100 keV =lm
300=ﬃﬃﬃ
Lp
L>100 keV =lm8
>><
>>:ðB:4:2Þ
(B 153) The quality factor function Q(L) was given in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b).
The function is the outcome of judgements taking account of results of radiobiolog-
ical investigations on cellular and molecular systems as well as on the results of ani-mal experiments. The radiobiological database for the assessment of this function islargely unchanged since 1990 (see ICRP, 2003c) and no changes are proposed.
(B 154) The quality factor Qat a point in tissue is then given by:
Q¼
1
DZ1
L¼0QðLÞDLdL ðB:4:3Þ
where DL¼dD
dLis the distribution of DinLfor the charged particles contributing to
absorbed dose at the point of interest. This function is particularly important forneutrons because various types of secondary charged particles are produced in tissueby neutron interactions.
(B 155) Diﬀerent operational dose quantities are required for diﬀerent tasks in
radiological protection. These include area monitoring for controlling the radiationin workplaces and for deﬁning controlled or restricted areas, and individual monitor-
ing for the control and limitation of individual exposures. While measurements with
an area monitor are preferably performed free in air, personal dosimeters are wornon the body. As a consequence, in a given situation, the radiation ﬁeld ‘seen’ by anarea monitor free in air diﬀers from that ‘seen’ by a personal dosimeter worn on thebody where the radiation ﬁeld is strongly inﬂuenced by the backscatter and absorp-tion of radiation in the body. The use of diﬀerent operational dose quantities reﬂectsthese diﬀerences.
(B 156) Table B.5 can be used in order to describe the application of the diﬀerent
operational dose quantities for the diﬀerent tasks of monitoring of external
exposures.
(B 157) Using the scheme of Table B.5, it is not necessary to use the terms ‘strongly
penetrating radiation’ (also called ‘penetrating radiation’) and ‘low-penetrating radi-ation’ (also called ‘weakly penetrating radiation’) in specifying the range of applica-tion of the operational quantities. ICRU (1993b) stated that H
*(10) and Hp(10) are
designed for monitoring strongly penetrating radiation, e.g., photons (above about12 keV) and neutrons, while H
0(0.07, X)a n d Hp(0.07) are applied for monitoring
low-penetrating radiation, e.g., beta particles. Furthermore, Hp(0.07) is also used
296ICRP Publication 103for monitoring the doses to the hands and feet from all ionising radiation. The rarely
used quantities H0(3,X) and Hp(3) for monitoring the exposure of the lens of the eye
are not included in this scheme. Monitoring of Hp(0.07) can be used for the same
monitoring purpose (see also this Section, paragraphs B 165 – B 167).
(B 158) There are situations in which individual monitoring is not used and where
area monitoring or computational methods are applied to assess individual expo-sures. These situations include the assessment of doses to aircrew, prospective doseassessments and assessment of doses in workplaces and the natural environment.
Operational quantities for area monitoring
(B 159) For all types of external radiation, the operational quantities for area
monitoring are deﬁned on the basis of a dose equivalent value at a point in a simplephantom, the ICRU sphere. It is a sphere of tissue-equivalent material (30 cm in
diameter, ICRU (soft) tissue with density: 1 g cm
/C03, and mass composition: 76.2%
oxygen, 11.1% carbon, 10.1% hydrogen, and 2.6% nitrogen). For radiation monitor-ing, in most cases it adequately approximates the human body as regards the scatter-ing and attenuation of the radiation ﬁelds under consideration.
(B 160) The operational quantities for area monitoring deﬁned in the ICRU
sphere should retain their character of a point quantity and the property of additiv-ity. This is achieved by introducing the terms ‘expanded’ and ‘aligned’ radiation ﬁeldin the deﬁnition of these quantities.
(B 161) An expanded radiation ﬁeld, deﬁned as a hypothetical ﬁeld, is a radiation
ﬁeld in which the spectral and the angular ﬂuence have the same value in all points ofa suﬃciently large volume equal to the value in the actual ﬁeld at the point of interest.The expansion of the radiation ﬁeld ensures that the whole ICRU sphere is thought tobe exposed to a homogeneous radiation ﬁeld with the same ﬂuence, energy distribu-tion and direction distribution as in the point of interest of the real radiation ﬁeld.
(B 162) If all radiation is aligned in the expanded radiation ﬁeld so that it is op-
posed to a radius vector Xspeciﬁed for the ICRU sphere, the aligned and expanded
radiation ﬁeld is obtained. In this hypothetical radiation ﬁeld, the ICRU sphere is
homogeneously irradiated from one direction, and the ﬂuence of the ﬁeld is the inte-gral of the angular diﬀerential ﬂuence at the point of interest in the real radiationﬁeld over all directions. In the expanded and aligned radiation ﬁeld, the value ofTable B.5. Application of operational dose quantities for monitoring

297ICRP Publication 103the dose equivalent at any point in the ICRU sphere is independent of the direction
distribution of the radiation in the real radiation ﬁeld. Conversion coeﬃcients relat-ing radiation ﬁeld quantities to the operational quantities are usually calculatedassuming a vacuum outside of the phantom considered.
(B 163) Ambient dose equivalent, H
*(10). For area monitoring the operational
quantity for assessing eﬀective dose is the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), deﬁned
by (ICRU, 2001b):
/C15The ambient dose equivalent ,H*(10), at a point in a radiation ﬁeld, is the dose
equivalent that would be produced by the corresponding expanded and alignedﬁeld in the ICRU sphere at a depth of 10 mm on the radius vector opposingthe direction of the aligned ﬁeld.
(B 164) In most practical situations of external radiation exposure, the ambient
dose equivalent fulﬁls the aim of providing a conservative estimate or upper limitfor the value of the limiting quantities. This is not always the case for persons in highenergy radiation ﬁelds such as in the vicinity of high energy accelerators and in cos-mic ray ﬁelds (Pelliccioni, 1998). The depth at which secondary charged particleequilibrium is achieved is very important in these cases. For very high energy parti-
cles a depth of 10 mm in ICRU tissue, as deﬁned with the operational quantities, is
not suﬃcient to complete the charged particle build-up in front of that point andhence the operational quantities will underestimate eﬀective dose. In radiation ﬁeldsrelevant for aircrew exposure, however, H
*(10) appears to be an appropriate opera-
tional quantity if the recommended radiation weighting factors for neutrons andprotons (see Section 3.5, paragraphs B 100 – B 123) are considered (Pelliccioni, per-sonal communication).
(B 165) Directional dose equivalent, H
0(d,X). For area monitoring of low-penetrat-
ing radiation, the operational quantity is the directional dose equivalent, H0(0.07, X)
or, in rare cases, H0(3,X) deﬁned as follows:
/C15Thedirectional dose equivalent ,H0(d,X), at a point in a radiation ﬁeld, is the dose
equivalent that would be produced by the corresponding expanded ﬁeld in theICRU sphere at a depth, d, on a radius in a speciﬁed direction X.
/C15For low-penetrating radiation it is d= 0.07 mm, and H0(d,X) is then written
H0(0.07, X).
(B 166) In the case of monitoring the dose to the lens of the eye, H0(3,X)w i t h
d= 3 mm was recommended by ICRU. The quantities directional dose equivalent,
H0(3,X), and personal dose equivalent Hp(3), however, have rarely been used in
practice and very few instruments exist for measuring these quantities. It is suggested
that their use is discontinued because the monitoring of the exposure to the eye lensis also suﬃciently achieved if the dose to the eye lens is assessed in terms of the otheroperational quantities. H
p(0.07) is normally used for this special purpose (ICRU
1998).
(B 167) For area monitoring of low-penetrating radiation, H0(0.07, X) is almost
exclusively used. With unidirectional radiation incidence, mainly occurring in cali-bration procedures, the quantity may be written H
0(0.07, a), where ais the angle
298ICRP Publication 103between the direction Xand the direction opposite to radiation incidence. In radio-
logical protection practice the direction Xis often not speciﬁed, because it is mostly
the maximum value of H0(0.07, X) at the point of interest which is of importance. It
is usually obtained by rotating the dose rate meter during the measurement andlooking for the maximum reading.
Operational quantities for individual monitoring
(B 168) Individual monitoring of external exposure is usually performed with per-
sonal dosimeters worn on the body, and the operational quantity deﬁned for thisapplication takes this situation into account. The true value of the operational quan-tity is determined by the irradiation situation near the point where the dosimeter isworn. The operational quantity for individual monitoring is the personal dose equiv-alent, H
p(d).
(B 169) The personal dose equivalent ,Hp(d), is the dose equivalent in ICRU (soft)
tissue at an appropriate depth, d, below a speciﬁed point on the human body. The
speciﬁed point is usually given by the position where the individual dosimeter is worn.For the assessment of eﬀective dose a depth d= 10 mm is recommended, and for
assessing equivalent dose to the skin, and to the hands and feet, a depth d= 0.07
mm. In special cases of monitoring the dose to the lens of the eye, it has been proposedthat a depth d= 3 mm would be appropriate (cf. paragraph B 166).
(B 170) An operational quantity for individual monitoring should allow the eﬀec-
tive dose to be assessed or should provide a conservative estimate under nearly all
irradiation conditions. This, however, requires that the personal dosimeter be worn
at a position on the body which is representative with respect to the exposure. For adosimeter position in front of the trunk, the quantity H
p(10) mostly furnishes a con-
servative estimate of Eeven in cases of lateral or isotropic radiation incidence on the
body. In cases of exposure from the back only, however, a dosimeter worn at thefront side and correctly measuring H
p(10), will not appropriately assess E. Also in
cases of partial body exposures the reading of a personal dosimeter may not providea representative value for the assessment of eﬀective dose.
B.4.2. Internal exposure
(B 171) The system of dose assessment for intakes of radionuclides that is gener-
ally applied relies ﬁrst on the calculation of the intake of a radionuclide either fromdirect measurements (e.g., measuring the radioactivity of the whole body by wholebody counter or of speciﬁc organs and tissues by external counting devices) or indi-rect measurements (e.g., measuring the radioactivity in urine, faeces, air or other
environmental samples). Biokinetic models have to be applied and the eﬀective dose
is calculated from the intake using reference dose coeﬃcients (doses per unit intake,Sv Bq
/C01) recommended by the Commission, and also reproduced in the EU Basic
Safety Standards Directive (EU, 1996) and in the International Basic Safety Stan-dards (IAEA, 1996). The Commission has provided dose coeﬃcients for intakesby inhalation and ingestion for a large number of radionuclides, relating the intakeof a speciﬁc radionuclide to the corresponding organ and eﬀective dose committed
299ICRP Publication 103within a speciﬁed period (ICRP, 1994b, 1996c). Dose coeﬃcients have been given for
members of the public and for adults who are occupationally exposed.
(B 172) A paper by Berkovski et al. (2003) indicated that an alternative approach
may be more useful in some circumstances. There can be advantages in calculatingthe committed eﬀective dose directly from the measurements using functions that re-
late them to the time of the intake. The measurements could be the whole body or
organ content, urine or faecal sample, or even an environmental measurement. Thisapproach would require that the Commission provides additional tables of ‘dose perunit content’ as a function of time after the intake for interpreting the measurementdata, but this approach should facilitate the interpretation of monitoring data inmany circumstances. It aids the analysis by ensuring that current models are usedin the dose assessment and limits the opportunity to make errors by reading datafrom tables.

300ICRP Publication 103B.5. Practical application of dose quantities in
radiological protection
(B 173) The main areas of application of dose quantities in radiological protection
of both occupational workers and the general public to exposures from controlled
sources are as follows:
/C15prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation of protection; and
/C15retrospective dose assessment for demonstrating compliance with dose limits.
(B 174) In practice, limits, constraints, reference values, and action levels are de-
ﬁned in terms of dose quantities in order to restrict the risks from radiation exposurefor both occupational workers and the public. The primary dose limits in radiolog-ical protection are given in terms of equivalent dose or eﬀective dose. Since neither
quantity can be directly measured, as has been explained above, they are assessed
using other measurable quantities, models and computations (Figs. B.1 and B.2).Depending on the situation considered (occupational or public exposure), diﬀerentprocedures are applied.
B.5.1. Radioactivity and committed dose
(B 175) Calculations of the radiation dose from internal or external exposure to
radiation emitted from radionuclides require information on their half-life and the
type, energies, and intensities of the nuclear and atomic radiations emitted by theradionuclide. The data of Publication 38 (ICRP, 1983b) are the same as have been
used in ICRP publications since 1980. The strategy for preparing a database of nu-clear decay data to replace Publication 38 has been outlined by Endo et al. (2003,
2005). This database will be used in future calculations of dose coeﬃcients.
(B 176) The activity Aof an amount of a radionuclide in a particular energy state
at a given time is the quotient of d Nby dt, where d Nis the expectation value of the
number of spontaneous nuclear transitions from that energy state in the time interval
dt, that is:
A¼/C0
dN
dtðB:5:1Þ
The SI unit of activity is s/C01with the special name becquerel (Bq), 1 Bq = 1 s/C01
(B 177) Radionuclides are frequently included in or absorbed onto other solid,
liquid, or gaseous material as well as being accompanied by stable isotopes of thesame element, and the amount is deﬁned by further quantities.
(B 178) The speciﬁc activity a
m(also called massic activity oractivity divided by
mass oractivity per mass ) of a speciﬁed radionuclide in a sample is the activity A
of the radionuclide in the sample divided by the total mass mof the sample.
(B 179) The activity concentration av(also called volumic activity oractivity divided
by volume oractivity per volume ) of a speciﬁed radionuclide in a volume is the activity
Aof the radionuclide in the volume divided by the volume V.
301ICRP Publication 103(B 180) The surface activity concentration a F(also called areal activity concentra-
tionoraeric activity ) of a speciﬁed radionuclide on a surface is the activity Aof
the radionuclide on the surface area Fdivided by the area.
(B 181) The names and symbols of these three quantities have not been consis-
tently standardised and there are some diﬀerences between the deﬁnitions used by
diﬀerent international bodies, including ICRU (ICRU, 2001b), ISO (ISO, 1992),
IEC (IEC 2005), and ICRP. Harmonisation would be very helpful to avoid errorsand inconsistencies.
(B 182) The activity intake, I, is the amount of the speciﬁed radionuclide entering
the human body by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin. This intakeis often used as an operational quantity for the assessment of eﬀective dose. In gen-eral, it cannot be measured directly, and must be determined from other data such aswhole or partial body measurements, assessments of activity in excreta or environ-
mental measurements such as air samples (Fig. B.1). In the case of accidents, activity
may also enter the body through wounds. A model to describe entry into the bodythrough wounds, and subsequent uptake to blood, has been described by NCRP(2006).
(B 183) Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate tissues over time
periods determined both by their physical half-life and their biological retentionwithin the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues over very shortperiods or throughout life. For example, in the case of intakes of tritiated water,
because of its short biological half-time of retention (10 days; physical half-life
of 12.3 yr), essentially all the dose is delivered within 2–3 months after intake.For
239Pu, however, both biological retention times and the physical half-life
(24,000 yr) are very long, and dose will be accumulated over the remaining lifespanof the individual. Thus, for inhalation of
239Pu as plutonium nitrate (a Type M
form in the Human Respiratory Tract Model, HRTM, ICRP, 1994a) models pre-dict that only about 10% of the committed eﬀective dose is received within the ﬁrstyear and about 30% by the end of 10 years. These and other examples are shown in
Fig. B.5. The ﬁgure also shows the diﬀerent rates of accumulation of committed
equivalent doses to diﬀerent tissues after inhalation of insoluble thorium–232 (TypeS).
(B 184) The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of
radiation dose over extended periods of time led to the deﬁnition of committed dosequantities. The committed dose from an incorporated radionuclide is the total doseexpected to be delivered within a speciﬁed time period. The committed equivalent
dose,H

ted eﬀective dose ,EðsÞ, is then given by

TwTHTðsÞð B:5:3Þ
302ICRP Publication 103The Commission continues to recommend that, for compliance with dose limits and
management of staﬀ, the committed dose is assigned to the year in which the intakeoccurred.
(B 185) For workers, the committed dose is normally evaluated over the 50-year
period following the intake. The commitment period of 50 years is a rounded valueconsidered by the Commission to be the life expectancy of a young person enteringthe workforce. The committed eﬀective dose from intakes is also used in prospectivedose estimates for members of the public. In these cases a commitment period of 50
years is considered for adults. For infants and children the dose is evaluated to age
70 years (ICRP, 1996c).
B.5.2. Reference phantoms
(B 186) Eﬀective dose is deﬁned for the sex-averaged Reference Person (Section
B.3.4). To determine eﬀective dose, ﬁrst the equivalent doses in the organs and tis-sues of the reference male and the reference female have to be evaluated and then
averaged in order to obtain the equivalent doses of the Reference Person. Eﬀective
dose is obtained by multiplying these with sex-averaged tissue weighting factorsand summing over all tissue weighted equivalent doses of the Reference Person(Eqn. B.3.7; Fig. B.3).
(B 187) The evaluation of equivalent doses for the Reference Male and Female,
and of eﬀective dose for the Reference Person, is based on the use of anthropomor-phic models. In the past, the Commission did not specify a particular phantom and,in fact, various mathematical phantoms such as hermaphrodite MIRD-type phan-
toms, the sex-speciﬁc models of Kramer et al. (1982) or the age-speciﬁc phantoms
of Cristy and Eckerman (1987) have been used.
(B 188) The Commission has now adopted male and female reference phantoms
for the calculation of equivalent doses for organs and tissues. In order to provideCommittment Period,  τ(y)e(t) / e(50)

303ICRP Publication 103a practicable approach for the assessment of equivalent doses and eﬀective dose, con-
version coeﬃcients relating to physical quantities, e.g., particle ﬂuence or air kermafor external exposure, and activity intake for internal exposure, are calculated forstandard exposure conditions of the reference phantoms (mono-energetic radiations,standard geometries for external irradiations, standard biokinetics of radionuclides
in the human body, etc.).
(B 189) Voxel (voxel: volume element) models, constructed from medical image
data of real persons, give a more realistic description of the human body than themathematical, stylised phantoms. Thus, the Commission decided to use voxel modelsto deﬁne its reference phantoms to be used for the update of organ dose conversioncoeﬃcients. These models (or computational phantoms) represent the ReferenceMale and Female, and have organ masses in compliance to the reference values,compiled in Publication 89 (ICRP, 2002).
(B 190) Two voxel reference models of an adult male and an adult female have
been developed (Zankl et al., 2005, Zankl et al., 2007), based on voxel models oftwo individuals whose body height and weight were close to those of the ReferenceMale and Female. They were developed from computed tomographic images ob-tained from high resolution continuous scans of a single individual and consist ofmillions of voxels, providing a three-dimensional representation of the human bodyand the spatial form of its constituent organs and structures. Approximately 140 or-gans and tissues were deﬁned, including diﬀerent skeletal tissues, cartilage, muscle
and the main blood vessels. The organ masses of both models were adjusted to
approximate those assigned to the Reference Adult Male and Female in Publication
89(ICRP, 2002) without distorting the realistic anatomy.
(B 191) The voxel reference models are thus computational representations of Ref-
erence Male and Female and can be used, together with codes simulating the radiationtransport and energy deposition, for the computation of dose coeﬃcients for workersand adult members of the public for internal exposure. The models can be used to com-pute the fraction of the energy of radiation emitted within source region S
ithat is ab-
sorbed in target region T j. Similarly the models will be used to compute the mean
absorbed dose, DT, in an organ or tissue T, from radiation ﬁelds external to the body,
and the relationship of the eﬀective dose to the quantities speciﬁc to the radiationﬁeld. Reference computational phantoms for children of diﬀerent ages will also bedeveloped for use in the calculation of dose coeﬃcients for members of the public.
B.5.3. Committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcients for internal exposure
(B 192) In the occupational setting, each intake of a radionuclide during a year is
assigned a committed eﬀective dose, EðsÞ, where a commitment period sof 50 years
is considered for workers. The same period is chosen for adult members of the pub-lic, while for infants and children the dose rate is integrated up to the age of 70 years(ICRP, 1996c).
(B 193) Committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcients, eðsÞ, are conversion coeﬃcients for a
Reference Person which provide numerical links between EðsÞand measurable quan-
304ICRP Publication 103tities, in this case between EðsÞand the intake of radionuclide(s) by either inhalation
ðeinhÞor ingestion ðeingÞof radionuclides. The dose coeﬃcients for the female and
male are based on the sex-speciﬁc physiological, anatomical, and biokinetic param-eters of the reference adult females and males. In addition, the dosimetric parametersin the evaluation of the mean absorbed dose in tissue T are derived for sex-speciﬁc
computational phantoms (see Section B.5.2).
(B 194) The contribution of the remainder tissue to the eﬀective dose is derived by
applying the tissue weighting factor for this group of tissues to the arithmetic averageequivalent dose among tissues not assigned an explicit tissue weighting but listed asremainder tissues (see Section B.3.5, paragraphs B 132 – B 145). The dose to remain-der tissues is evaluated in a manner that provides for additivity of the eﬀective dose.
(B 195) Thus, committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcients based on the sex and popula-
tion-averaged tissue weighting factors given in Table B.2, should be computed as

where hM

B.5.4. Conversion coeﬃcients for external exposure
(B 196) As described in Section B.4 the protection quantities, equivalent dose and
eﬀective dose, are not measurable, and their values are assessed using their relation-ship to either physical radiation ﬁeld quantities, e.g., air kerma free in air, K
a,o rp a r -
ticle ﬂuence, /, or operational dose quantities. Conversion coeﬃcients deﬁned for a
reference person provide numerical links between these quantities, and it is veryimportant that an internationally agreed set of conversion coeﬃcients is availablefor general use in radiological protection practice for occupational exposures andexposures of the public.
(B 197) Based on the work of a joint ICRU/ICRP task group, the Commissions
published reports (ICRP, 1996b, ICRU, 1997) on ‘Conversion coeﬃcients for usein radiological protection against external radiation’ which recommended a set ofevaluated data of conversion coeﬃcients for protection, and operational quantitiesfor external exposure to mono-energetic photon, neutron, and electron radiation un-der speciﬁc irradiation conditions. Most of the data for protection quantities usedfor the evaluation were calculated on the basis of MIRD-like models of the anatomy.In all cases, whole body exposure was assumed. For photons the mean absorbed
dose in an organ or tissue per air kerma free in air and the eﬀective dose per air ker-
ma free in air are given, while for neutrons and electrons the doses are related to theparticle ﬂuence. Furthermore, Publication 74 (ICRP, 1996b) explored in detail the
relationship between the protection quantity eﬀective dose and the operational dosequantities for speciﬁc idealised irradiation exposure geometries. Partial body
305ICRP Publication 103exposures were not discussed in that publication, and recommended conversion coef-
ﬁcients are not available for these cases.
(B 198) The deﬁnition of new reference phantoms for the human body (male and
female voxel phantoms based on medical imaging data) requires the calculation of anew set of conversion coeﬃcients for all types of radiation and irradiation geometries
considered. For most organs, however, the diﬀerences from the existing data of D
T;R
(ICRP, 1996b) are likely to be moderate. The values of the coeﬃcients for eﬀective
dose are also dependent on wRandwTvalues, and their changes may have a larger
inﬂuence on the changes in conversion coeﬃcients, especially for neutrons andprotons.
(B 199) The adoption of voxel-based reference phantoms (ICRP, 2002) requires
new calculations of conversion coeﬃcients for all radiations and irradiation geome-tries of interest which will replace the existing data sets (ICRP, 1996b). Calculations
for photons have shown that the changes in the values of eﬀective dose for photon
radiation are generally small (Zankl et al., 2002). At low photon energy, however,the change in exterior shape of the body and hence the depth of an organ in the ref-erence phantoms can inﬂuence the absorbed dose, e.g., for the thyroid. The resultantchange in the eﬀective dose coeﬃcients is expected to be rather modest (Schlattlet al., 2007).
B.5.5. Occupational exposure
(B 200) In cases of occupational exposure, doses may arise from external and inter-
nal radiation sources. For external exposure individual dose monitoring is usuallyperformed by measuring the personal dose equivalent H
p(10) using a personal dosim-
eter and taking this measured value as an acceptable assessment of the value of eﬀec-tive dose under the assumption of a uniform whole-body exposure. For internalexposure committed eﬀective doses are determined based on assessment of intakesof radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity re-
tained in the body or in daily excreta – in exceptional cases the airborne activity con-
centration can be used) and the application of appropriate dose coeﬃcients.
(B 201) For practical purposes the values from both kinds of quantities should be
combined in the assessment of the value of total eﬀective dose for demonstratingcompliance with dose limits and constraints.
(B 202) In most situations of occupational exposure the eﬀective dose, E,c a nb e
derived from operational quantities using the following formula:
EﬃH
pð10ÞþEð50Þð B:5:5Þ
where Hp(10) is the personal dose equivalent from external exposure (see Section
B.4.4) and E(50) the committed eﬀective dose from internal exposure.
(B 203) For the assessment of eﬀective dose from external exposure, according to
Eqn. (B.5.5) by monitoring the exposure with a personal dosimeter measuringH
p(10) it is necessary that the personal dosimeter is worn at a position on the body
which is representative of the exposure of the body. If the measured dose value is wellbelow the annual dose limit, the value of H
p(10) is usually taken as a suﬃcient
306ICRP Publication 103estimate of eﬀective dose. For high personal doses approaching or exceeding the an-
nual dose limit, or in strongly inhomogeneous radiation ﬁelds, however, this proce-dure might not be suﬃcient and it would then be necessary to carefully consider theactual situation of exposure in the human body in assessing the eﬀective dose. Theuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other protection measures may also
need to be taken into account.
(B 204) In the special case of exposure of aircrew to cosmic radiation, individual
monitoring with personal dosimeters, measuring H
p(10), is usually not performed for
the assessment of eﬀective dose. There may be other working environments in whichpersonal dosimeters are not used. In these cases the eﬀective dose from externalexposure can be assessed from monitoring ambient dose equivalent, H
*(10), or by
calculation using radiation ﬁeld properties.
(B 205) In cases of external exposure to low-penetrating radiation, e.g., b-rays,
Hp(10) will not suﬃciently assess eﬀective dose. In such cases H p(0.07) may be used
to assess the equivalent dose to the skin and its contribution to eﬀective dose byapplying the tissue weighting factor of 0.01 for the skin.
(B 206) The new computational phantoms will be used to compute the equivalent
dose in tissue T, H
T, from radiation ﬁelds external to the body and the relationship
of the eﬀective dose to the operational quantities speciﬁc to the radiation ﬁeld. Con-version coeﬃcients representing the eﬀective dose per unit ﬂuence or air kerma as afunction of radiation energy need to be calculated for various irradiation geometries
and will be applicable to external exposures at the workplace. The same reference
computational phantoms will also be used to derive dose coeﬃcients for equivalentdose, H
Tin relevant target regions as well as for eﬀective dose.
(B 207) In cases of external exposure to beta particles, very inhomogeneous irra-
diation of the body will occur. Even at eﬀective doses below the limits high local skindoses could occur where tissue reactions are possible. For this reason the annual lim-it on skin dose (500 mSv for occupational exposure) corresponds to the local skindose deﬁned by the mean equivalent dose in 0.07mm depth averaged over any 1
cm
2of the skin.
(B 208) The committed eﬀective dose, E(50), from intakes of radionuclides is as-
sessed by:
Eð50Þ¼X
jej;inhð50Þ/C1Ij;inhþX
jej;ingð50Þ/C1Ij;ing ðB:5:6Þ
where ej;inh(50) is the committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcient for activity intakes by
inhalation of a radionuclide j,Ij;inhis the activity intake of a radionuclide jby inha-
lation, ej;ing(50) is the committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcient for activity intakes of a
radionuclide jby ingestion, and Ij;ingis the activity intake of a radionuclide jby inges-
tion. In the calculation of the eﬀective dose from speciﬁc radionuclides, allowance
will need to be made for the characteristics of the material taken into the body.
(B 209) The dose coeﬃcients used in Eqn. (B.5.6) are those speciﬁed by the Com-
mission with no departure in anatomical, physiological, and biokinetic characteris-tics from those of the Reference Male and Reference Female (ICRP, 2002).Account may, however, be taken of the activity medium aerodynamic diameter
307ICRP Publication 103(AMAD) of the inhaled aerosol, and the chemical form of the particulate matter to
which the speciﬁed radionuclide is attached. The eﬀective dose assigned in the work-er’s dose record, the ‘dose of record’, is that value of eﬀective dose which the Refer-ence Person would experience owing to the radiation ﬁelds and activity intakesencountered by the worker (see Section 5.8). The commitment period of 50 years re-
lates to the life expectancy of a person entering the workforce, as noted in Section
B.5.1.
(B 210) The radiation dose from radon isotopes and their decay products may also
need to be taken into account in the overall dose assessment (ICRP, 1993b). If incor-poration of radionuclides through the skin occurs, an additional term for the asso-ciated eﬀective dose would have to be included in Eqn. (B.5.6). The incorporation ofradionuclides through uncontrolled events involving wounds has implications be-yond compliance with work practices, and thus these events are not included in
Eqn. (B.5.6). The signiﬁcance of these events must be evaluated and recorded, appro-
priate medical treatment provided, and further restriction of the worker’s exposureconsidered if warranted.
(B 211) Exposure to airborne noble gas radionuclides in the workplace may need
to be assessed beyond that indicated by H
p(10). In such cases it is necessary to in-
clude in Eqn. (B.5.6) a term representing the product of the time-integrated airborneconcentration of the noble gas and an eﬀective dose coeﬃcient for so-called submer-sion exposure. Such dose coeﬃcients are speciﬁed by the Commission for both pro-
spective and retrospective applications.
(B 212) In the assessment of committed eﬀective doses for workers from opera-
tional data related to an actual intake of speciﬁc radionuclide(s) or of radionuclideconcentration(s) in the air at a workplace it is often useful to refer these data to theAnnual Limit on Intake (ALI) and the Derived Air Concentration (DAC).
(B 213) The ALI was deﬁned in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b, paragraph S30) as
the activity intake (Bq) of a radionuclide which would lead to an eﬀective dose cor-responding to the annual limit E
limit ;w, under the expectation that the worker is ex-
posed to only this radionuclide. The ALI of radionuclide j is:
ALI j¼Elimit ;w
eð50ÞðB:5:7Þ
where e(50) is the corresponding reference committed eﬀective dose coeﬃcient in (Sv
Bq/C01). The Commission recommended in Publication 60 that the ALI should be
based on the dose limit of 0.020 Sv in a year, with no time averaging.
(B 214) The DAC is the activity concentration in air in Bq m/C03of the radionuclide
considered, which would lead to an intake of an ALI (Bq) assuming a gender-aver-aged breathing rate of 1.1 m
3h/C01and an annual working time of 2000 h (an annual
air intake of 2200 m3). Then the DAC of radionuclide j is given by:
DAC j¼ALI j
2200ðB:5:8Þ
308ICRP Publication 103(B 215) The Commission does not now give ALI values, because it considers that, for
compliance with dose limits, it is the total dose from external radiation as well asfrom intakes of radionuclides that must be taken into account as indicated above.It is, however, noted that the ALI concept can be useful in various practical situa-tions, e.g., in characterising the relative hazard of radiation sources to ensure that
appropriate administrative controls are in place.
(B 216) The DAC for inert gases which are not incorporated is limited by the eﬀec-
tive dose arising from radiations incident on the body from the airborne activity.Thus the DAC is given by
DAC ¼
Elimit ;w
2000 _esubðB:5:9Þ
where _esubis the eﬀective dose rate coeﬃcient [mSv m3(Bq h)/C01] for submersion in an
airborne cloud containing the noble gas radionuclide and 2000 h is the annual work-
ing time. For some radionuclides the DAC is limited by the dose to the skin.
B.5.6. Public exposure
(B 217) Public exposures can occur from natural radiation sources, which may be
modiﬁed by human activities, from technical installations, or from combinations ofsuch sources. The annual eﬀective dose to members of the public is the sum of theeﬀective dose obtained within one year from external exposure and the committed
eﬀective dose from incorporated radionuclides within this year. The dose is usually
not obtained by individual monitoring as for occupational exposure but is mainlydetermined by environmental measurements, habit data, and modelling. It can beestimated from:
/C15Simulation and prediction of radionuclide levels in eﬄuents from the technical
installation or source during the design period;
/C15Eﬄuent and stray radiation monitoring during the operational period; and
/C15Radioecological modelling (pathway analysis of environmental transport, e.g.,
from the release of radionuclides and transport through soil to plants to animalsto humans).
(B 218) External exposures of individuals may occur from radionuclides released
from installations and which are present in the air, soil, or water. Doses can be cal-culated from activity concentrations in the environment by modelling andcomputation.
(B 219) Internal exposures can occur by inhalation of airborne radionuclides from
a cloud, inhalation of resuspended radionuclides, and by ingestion of contaminated
food or water.
B.5.7. Medical exposures of patients
(B 220) The use of eﬀective dose for assessing the exposure of patients has severe
limitations that must be taken into account by medical professionals. Eﬀective dose
309ICRP Publication 103can be of value for comparing doses from diﬀerent diagnostic procedures – and in a
few special cases from therapeutic procedures – and for comparing the use of similartechnologies and procedures in diﬀerent hospitals and countries as well as using dif-ferent technologies for the same medical examination. Such data have been reviewedby UNSCEAR (1988, 2000). For planning the exposure of patients and risk-beneﬁt
assessments, however, the equivalent dose or preferably the absorbed dose to irradi-
ated tissues is the more relevant quantity. This is especially the case when risk esti-mates are intended.
(B 221) Medical exposures of patients to external radiation are commonly con-
cerned with only limited parts of the body and it is important that medical profes-sionals are fully aware of the doses to normal tissue in the irradiated ﬁelds. Withlow tissue weighting factors for skin and relatively low values for a number of otherbody tissues partial body exposure can result in appreciable equivalent doses to local
tissues even though the corresponding eﬀective dose may be small. Similar consider-
ations apply to doses from intakes of radionuclides.
B.5.8. Application of eﬀective dose
(B 222) The main and primary use of eﬀective dose is to provide a means of dem-
onstrating compliance with dose limits. In this sense eﬀective dose is used for regu-latory purposes worldwide.
(B 223) Eﬀective dose is used to limit the occurrence of stochastic eﬀects (cancer
and heritable eﬀects) and is not applicable to the assessment of the possibility of tis-sue reactions. In the dose range below the annual eﬀective dose limit tissue reactionsshould not occur. Only in a few cases (e.g., an acute localised exposure of a singleorgan with a low tissue weighting factor such as the skin) could the use of the annuallimit on eﬀective dose be insuﬃcient to avoid tissue reactions. In such cases local tis-sue doses will also need to be assessed.
(B 224) The calculation of reference dose coeﬃcients for intakes of radionuclides
and dose conversion factors for external exposures is based on reference anatomical
data for the organs and tissues of the human body together with deﬁned biokineticand dosimetric models. The general approach is to monitor individuals or the envi-ronment and from these measurement data to assess the external exposure or radio-nuclide intake. The dose coeﬃcients and dose conversion factors published by theCommission are then used to assess the eﬀective dose from the exposure or the in-take. The weighting factors used in the calculation of reference dose coeﬃcientsand conversion factors apply to a population of both sexes and all ages. Thus dose
coeﬃcients, and the reference models and weighting factors used in their calculation,
are not individual speciﬁc but apply to a Reference Person for the purposes of reg-ulatory control. Conversion coeﬃcients or dose coeﬃcients are calculated for a ref-erence adult worker or a reference member of the public of a deﬁned age group.
(B 225) The eﬀective dose of a worker assessed by the sum of the measured per-
sonal dose equivalent, H
P(10), and the committed eﬀective dose estimated from re-
sults of individual monitoring of the worker, and ICRP reference biokinetic anddosimetric computational models, is called dose of record . Dose of record is assigned
310ICRP Publication 103to the worker for purposes of recording, reporting, and retrospective demonstration
of compliance with regulatory dose limits.
(B 226) Particularly in retrospective dose assessments for occupational exposures,
information may be available that diﬀers from the reference parameter values used inthe calculation of dose conversion factors and dose coeﬃcients. In such situations it
may be appropriate, depending on the level of exposure, to use speciﬁc data in the
assessment of exposure or the intake and calculation of doses. It is, therefore, impor-tant to distinguish between those parameter values that might be altered in the cal-culation of eﬀective dose under the particular circumstances of an exposure andthose values that cannot be changed under the deﬁnition of eﬀective dose.
(B 227) In the assessment of eﬀective dose in occupational situations of exposure
to radionuclides, changes may reasonably be made to the physical and chemicalcharacteristics of inhaled or ingested radionuclides to better assess intakes and expo-
sures. These changes need to be notiﬁed. Examples of the use of material-speciﬁc
data in the calculation of doses from inhaled radionuclides have been given in Sup-
porting Guidance 3 (ICRP, 2002).
(B 228) For retrospective assessments of occupational doses to speciﬁc individuals
in situations where the radiation dose could exceed a limit or constraint, it may beconsidered appropriate to make speciﬁc individual estimates of dose and risk. Con-sideration might then be given to changes in dosimetric assumptions used to calcu-late absorbed doses, and organ-speciﬁc risk estimates relating to the age and sex of
the individual and the radiation exposure. Such changes from reference parameter
values are not consistent with the deﬁnition or intended use of eﬀective dose. Theyshould only be performed by radiation protection specialists, with the level of eﬀortdetermined by the level of exposure. In such situations the changes of parameter val-ues must be described.
(B 229) In cases of incidents and accidents that could give rise to tissue reactions
(deterministic eﬀects), it is necessary to estimate absorbed dose and dose rates to or-gans and tissues and to take into account dose–response relationships to assess the
potential for radiation eﬀects that are likely to occur above dose thresholds (NCRP,
1990; ICRP, 1989b). It should also be noted that, in cases of accidents involvinghigh-LET radiations (neutrons and alpha particles), radiation weighting factorsðw
RÞapplicable to stochastic eﬀects do not apply to tissue reactions; values of rela-
tive biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) relevant to tissue reactions should be used.
(B 230) Eﬀective dose is a risk-related quantity based upon the consequences of
whole body exposure. The wTvalues are selected values that are chosen to take ac-
count of the contribution of individual organs and tissues to total radiation detri-
ment from stochastic eﬀects, in terms of cancer and heritable eﬀects, on the basis
of current epidemiological (or, for heritable eﬀects, experimental) evidence. Further-more, w
Tvalues are averages applying to both sexes and all ages. While eﬀective dose
is sometimes used for pilot studies aimed at generation of hypotheses of eﬀects ofradiation on human health, it is not an appropriate quantity for use in epidemiolog-ical studies of radiation risks. Epidemiological analyses instead require estimates ofabsorbed doses to tissues and organs, taking full account, to the extent possible, ofthe circumstances of exposure and the characteristics of the exposed individuals in
311ICRP Publication 103the study population. Similarly, absorbed doses, not eﬀective doses, are required for
calculations of probability of causation of cancer in exposed individuals.
(B 231) In summary, eﬀective dose should be used for assessing exposure and con-
trolling stochastic eﬀects for regulatory purposes. It can be used to demonstrate com-pliance with dose limits and for dose records. Eﬀective dose provides a convenient
quantity for the assessment of overall radiation exposure, taking account of all expo-
sure pathways, internal and external, for dose record keeping and regulatory pur-poses. Used in this way eﬀective dose is a valuable quantity for practicalradiological protection purposes although it is not individual-speciﬁc but appliesto a Reference Person. In retrospective situations the assessment of eﬀective dosegives an insight into the quality of radiological protection and gives informationon whether the dose limits could have been exceeded.
(B 232) However, there are situations in which the use of eﬀective dose is not
appropriate, and individual organ and tissue absorbed doses should be used instead.
These include epidemiological studies, assessment of the probability of causation ofcancer, assessments of the possibility of tissue reactions, or assessments of doseswhen treatment or medical surveillance are needed.
B.5.9. Collective dose
(B 233) The dosimetric quantities for radiological protection discussed above refer
to a Reference Person. The task of radiological protection includes optimisation and
the reduction of radiation exposure of groups of occupationally exposed persons orof the public. For this purpose ICRP has introduced the collective dose quantities(ICRP, 1977, 1991b) which should be used and understood as instruments for opti-misation. These quantities take account of the group of persons exposed to radiationfrom a source and of a speciﬁed time period of exposure. The quantities have beendeﬁned as the collective equivalent dose, S
T, which relates to a tissue or an organ T,
and the collective eﬀective dose, S (ICRP, 1991b). The special name of the unit of
these collective dose quantities is the man sievert (man Sv).
(B 234) Collective eﬀective dose is deﬁned in Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) as the
integral over eﬀective doses received by the population (paragraph A34). The Com-mission introduced both the collective equivalent dose and the collective eﬀectivedose. Since the intent of the collective quantities is to serve as an instrument in opti-misation of radiological protection especially for occupational exposures, and thecollective equivalent dose is used only in special circumstances, only the collectiveeﬀective dose is discussed in the present Recommendations.
(B 235) In occupational exposure, the quantity collective eﬀective dose is used for
optimisation of planned exposure situations of a group of workers. The collectiveeﬀective dose, and the distribution of individual doses, is assessed prospectivelyfor diﬀerent operational scenarios before starting the planned work. Collective eﬀec-tive dose is then used as a relevant parameter in the decision process for the choice ofthe operational scenario. Comparison of the prospectively assessed collective eﬀec-tive dose, and the sum of all individual eﬀective doses obtained from monitoring data
312ICRP Publication 103after the completion of the work, can provide relevant information for future opti-
misation procedures and radiation protection measures. Collective eﬀective dose canalso be used as an instrument for comparing radiological technologies in medicalpractices and comparing the same radiological technologies at diﬀerent locations(e.g., diﬀerent hospitals, diﬀerent countries).
(B 236) The deﬁnition of collective quantities, as described above, has led people in
some cases to use collective eﬀective dose incorrectly for summing up radiation expo-sures over a wide range of doses, over very long time periods and over large geo-graphical regions, and to calculate on this basis radiation-related detriments.However, such a use of collective eﬀective dose would only be meaningful if therewere suﬃcient knowledge of the risk coeﬃcients for the detrimental radiation eﬀectsin all dose ranges which contribute to the collective dose (Kaul et al., 1987). Owing tothe large uncertainties, such a knowledge of risk coeﬃcients is not available in the
very low dose range.
(B 237) In this context it has to be realised that the risk factors, e.g., for carcino-
genesis at low doses, are obtained from the extrapolation of epidemiological data ob-served in dose ranges of medium and high radiation doses. As described in SectionB.2, the extrapolation is based on the assumption of a linear dose eﬀect relationshipwithout a threshold (LNT model). The Commission considers that, in the low doserange, the risk factors have a high degree of uncertainty. This is particularly the casefor very low individual doses which are only small fractions of the radiation dose re-
ceived from natural sources. The use of collective eﬀective dose under such condi-
tions for detailed risk estimates is not a valid procedure.
(B 238) To avoid aggregation of low individual doses over extended time periods
and wide geographical regions the range in eﬀective dose and the time period shouldbe limited and speciﬁed. The collective eﬀective dose due to individual eﬀective dosevalues between E
1andE2for the time period DTis deﬁned as:
SðE1;E2;DTÞ¼ZE2
E1EdN
dE/C20/C21
DTdE ðB:5:10Þ
The number of individuals experiencing an eﬀective dose in the range E1toE2,NðE1,
E2,DT) is:
NðE1;E2;DTÞ¼ZE2
E1dN
dE/C20/C21
DTdE ðB:5:11Þ
and the average value of eﬀective dose /C22EðE1;E2;DTÞin the interval of individual
doses between E1andE2for the time period DTis:
/C22EðE1;E2;DTÞ¼1
NðE1;E2;DTÞZE2
E1EdN
dE/C20/C21
DTdE ðB:5:12Þ
(B 239) For a group of individuals, the collective eﬀective dose Scould also be cal-
culated by:
S¼X
iEiNi ðB:5:13Þ
313ICRP Publication 103where Eiis the average eﬀective dose in the subgroup i, and Niis the number of indi-
viduals in this subgroup (ICRP, 1991b).
(B 240) In the calculation and interpretation of collective eﬀective dose, the follow-
ing aspects should be considered and critically reviewed in order to avoid a misuse ofcollective eﬀective dose:
/C15Number of exposed individuals;
/C15Age and sex of exposed persons;
/C15Range of individual doses;
/C15Dose distribution in time; and
/C15Geographical distribution of exposed individuals.

315ICRP Publication 103B.6. Uncertainties and judgements in radiological
protection
(B 241) In Publication 60 (ICRP, 1991b) the Commission stressed, as has been
done in this document, that the assessment of radiation dose is fundamental to
radiological protection, although neither the equivalent dose in an organ or tissue
nor the eﬀective dose can be measured directly. In the evaluation of these doses,models are necessary to simulate the geometry of the external exposure, the biokinet-ics of the intake and retention of radionuclides in the human body, and the humananatomy. Dosimetric considerations with respect to methodology and practical useare also of great importance.
(B 242) These models and their parameter values have been developed in many
cases from experimental investigations and human studies in order to derive ‘best
estimates’ of model parameter values. It is recognised that there may be large uncer-
tainties in the values of some of the parameters and in the formulation or structuresof the models themselves. Some of these uncertainties have been addressed in variouspublications (Leggett et al., 1998, ICRP, 2002, Harrison et al. 2001, Likhtarev et al.,2003) and estimates of the illustrated variability of parameter values, e.g., for phys-iological and anatomical characteristics have been demonstrated (ICRP, 2002). Suchvariations of parameter values are of particular signiﬁcance with respect to the mod-els necessary for dose assessments from internal exposure. From situations with a
broad range of values the necessary parameters are selected by judgements in order
to evaluate weighting factors and other parameters for the dose assessment.
(B 243) It is important to distinguish between uncertainty and variability. Uncer-
tainty refers to the level of conﬁdence that can be placed in a given parameter valueor prediction of a model or estimate of the central value of dose for a population.Uncertainties of the measurements in the low ranges of the determined parametersare included. It is an important factor in all extrapolation procedures and particu-larly in assessing radiation doses and their eﬀects in the low dose range.
(B 244) Variability (strictly, biological variability) refers to quantitative diﬀerences
between diﬀerent members of the population in question, e.g., with respect to theirphysiological and metabolic parameters. For example, two healthy persons of thesame age and sex and having identical diets may exhibit substantially diﬀerent ratesof transit of material through the colon. Similarly individual members of a populationwill show substantial variation in the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid for the sameinitial intake. Variability will be an important source of uncertainty in the estimate of acentral value when the estimate is based on a few, highly variable observations.
(B 245) Risk factors for stochastic eﬀects, from which w
RandwTvalues are de-
rived, have been obtained from epidemiological and experimental radiobiologicaldata in the medium and higher dose ranges. The risk factors for the lower doseranges that are important for radiological protection as well as the concept of eﬀec-tive dose, are based on extrapolation from the measured data in the higher doseranges using the linear-non-threshold model (LNT model).
(B 246) This model is an assumption which has not been scientiﬁcally validated. It
is considered to be the most appropriate interpretation of current experimental and
317ICRP Publication 103epidemiological data and is consistent with current understanding of stochastic radi-
ation eﬀects. However, its use also introduces a high degree of uncertainty, especiallyin relation to exposures at low doses and low dose rates (UNSCEAR, 2000). Theassumed linearity of dose–response, and the additivity of doses are necessaryconditions for the concepts used in radiological protection in the low dose ranges,
especially for the use of eﬀective dose, as described in previous sections.
(B 247) The uncertainties which are associated with the assessment of radiation
doses and health detriments have been discussed in various sections of this docu-ment. Some of the more important factors considered are:
/C15The heterogeneity of energy deposition within tissues has been described in the
low dose ranges of external as well as of internal exposures (Section B.3.2).
/C15The heterogeneous distribution of radionuclides has been described in the body
and in tissues which is especially signiﬁcant when considering ionising particleswith short ranges such as alpha particles (Sections B.3.2, B.3.3).
/C15For dose assessments from internal exposures, the biokinetic models and their
parameter values are variable and dependent on the speciﬁc conditions of expo-sure. Frequently, animal data have to be used and to be extrapolated to humans.
/C15Human populations vary worldwide on ethnic grounds with respect to physiolog-
ical and other parameters (ICRP, 2002). Variability can become large when radio-ecological models are used to assess concentrations of radionuclides in food, andhence intakes from habit data as the parameters are frequently very uncertain,biological variability is large, and measured activity values are frequently low.
/C15The RBE values which are important for the choice of w
Rvalues vary with the end
point considered and the experimental design. Frequently the values rely on ani-mal and in-vitro data (Section B.3.5, paragraphs B 73 – B 131).
/C15The target cells for the induction of cancer and their location in tissues are
unclear. The dose response in the low dose range for stochastic eﬀects, the modeof extrapolation and the LNT model are uncertain (Annex A).
/C15For the estimation of parameters connected to the assessment of health
detriments, sex averaging is performed which causes uncertainty (Section B.3.4).
(B 248) The degree of uncertainty varies for the various parameters and diﬀerent
circumstances in deﬁned exposure situations. Therefore, it is not possible to give gen-eral values of uncertainties, but considerations of this kind should be and have beenmade for special cases and should be included in comprehensive evaluations (e.g.,CERRIE, 2004, ICRP, 2006c). In general it can be said that uncertainties in theassessment of radiation doses from internal exposures including the biokinetics of
radionuclides are larger than those from external exposures. The degree of uncer-
tainty diﬀers between various radionuclides.
(B 249) The Commission is aware of these uncertainties, and eﬀorts are being
undertaken to critically evaluate and to reduce them wherever possible. However,for prospective dose assessments in regulatory processes the Commission takes theposition that the dosimetric models, as well as the parameter values that it recom-mends for determining doses from quantitative information about radiation ﬁeldsat working places and in the environment or from intakes of radionuclides, should
318ICRP Publication 103be taken as reference models. These values have been ﬁxed by convention and are
not subject to uncertainty.
(B 250) Equally the Commission considers that the dosimetric models and param-
eter values which are needed for the purpose of recommending dose limits or con-straints are deﬁned as reference data and, therefore, are not uncertain.
Nevertheless, these models and values are re-evaluated periodically and may be up-
dated by ICRP on the basis of such evaluations when new scientiﬁc data and infor-mation become available.
(B 251) It should be noted that the dosimetric models, conversion coeﬃcients, and
other parameters recommended by the Commission have been developed principallyand primarily for planning and assessing normal occupational exposures, for plan-ning for discharges into the environment and for generic assessments of doses. Theyare needed to demonstrate compliance with dose limits. These are circumstances in
which doses are low (Section B.5.5). At higher doses, for example following accidental
exposures, or for epidemiological studies, more speciﬁc information on the individualand the exposure conditions are needed. In such situations all sources of uncertaintyshould be taken into consideration including the variability of individual anatomicaland physiological data, speciﬁc information on radionuclide source-term, biokinetics,and the direction of radiation incidence in cases of external exposure.
(B 252) In conclusion, the reference models and their parameter values have been
developed for use in prospective radiological protection. These models and parameter
values are also used for demonstrating compliance with dose limits when exposures
are low but in general should not be used for individual risk estimates or for epidemi-ological studies. In cases where this is done the uncertainty must be critically re-viewed. If such individual data are not available the reference parameters may beused but this must be clearly documented. This limitation of usage applies particularlyto eﬀective dose. For the assessment and judgement of individual cases absorbeddoses to organs or tissues should be used together with the most appropriate bioki-netic parameters, data on biological eﬀectiveness of the ionising radiation and risk
coeﬃcients. In these cases uncertainties should be taken into consideration.
